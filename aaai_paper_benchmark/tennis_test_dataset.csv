33,2626,9495,What do you think changed when you were up 4-0 to when she started getting those games?,"Well, I think on my side nothing change.  I think she just start to really play some unbelievable shots.  And even the rally was very tough, but she was coming with some really super shots on those long rallies. So I think on my side nothing change, but she step it up with some first serve really hard and then doesn't make a lot of mistakes in the game and make me work very hard and move so well and defend so well. I needed to come up with something unbelievable to win points, so I cannot make it on a regular basis.  And the first four games she wasn't hitting the ball as hard.  I was able to go more inside the court and dictate more the games, but afterward she just played too good I think.",You faced her four times this year already.,Uh-huh.,Is there anything she did particularly well today that she didn't do well the first three times?,"I think the difference between her on clay and grass and on hard court is her movement.  On clay she struggle a lot more to move and to slide. On grass with some bad bounce and also it's more difficult to move, she really struggled more on this side of her game.  I think her movement is the key of her game.  She is not hitting super hard but she moves very well. I think on the hard courts you have to hit maybe five, six times like this from the lines to make points.  You don't need to hit like this on clay and grass courts.  So on hard courts she's really hard to beat.",You called for a trainer after the first set.,"No, no.  I just had to readjust the tape on my nails because I had a broken nail, so...","Overall are you pretty pleased with your preparation for the US Open?  Seems like you've been improving over the summer, right.","Yeah, of course.  You know, I feel like my game a really almost clicking together and almost 100% before to go to the Open, so it feels good. I have a pretty the good draw in the first two rounds and it's getting tougher, but the two first rounds are the most important and I will try to get this one under my belt and after I will see. But overall I'm pretty confident before the Open.  Even if I don't win the match today I feel like I play pretty good, so that's fine to me.",Yes,Yes, 
108,8792,32001,"Now that you have a free day tomorrow, will you go into the players box to watch Dimitrov against Andy Murray?",I haven't had a chance to think about that as I just finished my match 30 minutes ago.,"When you won here so young, it looked like you had a game sort of tailor made for this surface. How has your relationship with grass changed over these last 10 years?","Despite the results and the fact that I've lost here and haven't had good results, I still love playing on grass. I think my game suits the surface extremely well. You know, it's always tough to say that you love playing out there after losing a match, but I really do. You know, considering I didn't play any matches, I thought I felt much better on it than I did the previous couple of years.",Has it become more challenging or do you feel it's circumstances one year to the next?,"Well, the surface itself has changed since 10 years ago. I don't think we had the rallies that I had with Kerber today 10 years ago against anyone.","You've come in for a little bit of criticism about the sweets shop, given it's not the kind of food for athletes.",Criticism but great sales afterwards. It's kind of like the best day after the criticisms. If you want to provide some more...,Which of the sweets do you eat?,"Well, there's 15 of them. I kind of go back and forth between my favorites.",Yes,Yes, 
240,11815,43048,What did you do in the off season to get yourself physically the way you want to coming into this year?,"I just tried to run and hit balls. Tried to get to the gym. The usual, nothing like secret or anything like that.",But you had enough energy and your body was responding the way you wanted it to?,"Yeah, sure. (Smiling.)",This is the kind of match in the past that you would have expected yourself to win. It would have been routine to win. Did it feel at all that way today?,"I don't know. I don't think about the score when I'm out there. So even if I'm up 5Love, I don't see 5Love. I just see I need to get the set. That's kind of what I'm thinking about. Nothing is really routine. You never know how well your opponent is going to play or if you don't have a good day. Obviously it's nice to spend less time on the court, and not be in long sets. Obviously a win is a win no matter what it is, but it's nice when it's more routine.","How encouraging was the Hopman Cup for you? Speaking of time on court, you had a lot of time on court that one day. Just getting through that, was that important?","Definitely. I mean, it seems so long ago now. (Smiling.) I haven't played a competitive match in over a week. I definitely wish it would have been closer, but I got to play matches in Hopman Cup. That's great. I played six matches, singles and doubles. That was my first time. So I thought it was like really good, because you get to play a lot. You know, the regular tournaments if you lose in the first round or something then you're out of luck, so the Hopman Cup, even if you lose you still have got some luck left.",Are you still trying to maintain that kind of vegan whatever diet?,Yeah I think it's pretty well known I'm a cheagan.,UNK,UNK, 
259,19956,72480,"With the new coaching staff, how much is John still having input in the whole thing?","Obviously my dad is still there. He's the one that you taught me to play like this. Spent hours with him that I probably won't spend with no one in my life. He knows me the best. He's one of the reasons I am who I am today. Obviously my new coach is helping me out in a new way. Still got my dad on my side, which is very important to me. I think it's a very good team. I've always got two open minds and they're helping me. I'm positive with it and thankful for that.",Is there some contingency there for Melbourne given that he can't go on the grounds? Do you have chats with him after matches and that kind of thing? Is he going to be down there supporting you in other ways?,"Yeah, well moved down to Melbourne, so Melbourne is home for me now. Obviously he can't come in, but that's fine. I'll see him at home. If there is anything I need to hear, he'll tell me. It's very good. E. Like I said, I'm happy to be playing back in the tournaments. It's amazing for me. I'm improving. That's the most important thing.",When you came here last year you had just beaten Novak in Perth. Can you compare how you feel like you're traveling now compared to here 12 months ago?,"I probably wouldn't say I'm you know, the year has gone by quickly. It's tough to answer that question. Obviously I was playing very good at Hopman Cup this year and last year. This is my first tournament for the year. I won it last year. I'm not looking at it to defend it. I'm looking at obviously winning another title. If I start looking at defending the title I'll get nervous and I'm probably not going to defend it more than likely. I'm looking at this is as a positive and trying to win here as best as I can, regardless of what I have to defend.",Last year you said that by the end of the year you hoped to be in the top 10. Where do you set yourself this year since that didn't eventuate last year?,"No goals, but I'll get there eventually.",Do you look at last year as a disappointment given you didn't reach that goal of top 10?,"You know, if I'm 25 years old, 26 years old I would probably feel like that. Just turned 21, so I think I'm at the right age.",UNK,No, 
154,15478,56002,Is the problem you think the way you've been training or sometimes you've just not trained? You find other things to do?,"A bit of both. (Smiling.) It's the way you train. I know my tennis, when I'm playing well, is not  many people in the top 10, you know, top 15 struggle with my game. I can beat anyone, even at the age of 18, 19. But it can cost you, you know. You can be talented and head down, but I'm not going to let that happen to me.","In terms of outside influences, Davis Cup coaching scenarios, you respond a certain way in your private situation. What do you find is best for you?",Say that again.,"Comparing Davis Cup and preparing for ties compared to this, what's better for you: having someone like Pat Rafter around? Do you respond to that kind of thing?","Look, with me, like, you know, I can work with Pat  like the Davis Cup is great. I love working on the team, and I can't wait for when Davis Cup starts. I love being in that role of being in the team. To have a shot at even qualifying this year if I do so it will be huge. I think regardless of who's working with me, it's my sort of tennis my game is just it relies on me. People can say they can help you with a lot of tips. Even my dad who has been with me for 11 years has done a great job. You know, that can take the place, but saying people can help, it's not really for my tennis, it's all about me. I've got to find that in me. People give you great tips along the way and can help you and stuff, which I'm ready for any help, but you're not going to become Federer, Rafa, or Novak if you don't do it yourself. That's for sure.","Has your dad, your coach, been frustrated or annoyed at you for what you have admitted which is sort of a lack of application of training?","Yeah. I think there's also a few other things that are involved also last few eight weeks which I can't talk about. But it's a learning curve, and I'm lucky I'm getting hit with these things at this age now. In one way it's good for I think it's great. It's better that I won that I lost so I can wake up and find my tennis where it can be and where it can take me to the next few years.",Do you remember the last time you played him four years ago?,"Yeah, I lost 0 and 1 in juniors. You know, I think he played much better than I did second, third set. But see what's costing me today. Should have been realistically straight sets to me, 63 and I was playing well. But having dropped my confidence and my mental, I was  you know, players just can't wait to come back. When I'm down a set, all I want to do is come back and beat the guy. That's where I lacked off a bit today. He took his chance, and credit to him. He played very good tennis.",UNK,UNK, 
9,10194,37165,Was it last year that Petrova did a similar thing to you? Do you have empathy for her?,"No, I mean, there's probably not much you can say to make her feel any better or that's going to help, obviously. But, you know, I know her well. We were talking in the locker room. So, you know, she's a good girl like that. It's not like she's not going to talk to me for the next two months when I see her on the road. But, I mean, that's the sport we play. We step out there with two players. Sometimes things like that can happen. But just hope it's not going to make her confidence go even lower.",How did you recover from it 12 months ago?,"I just tried to leave it behind me. You know, I was probably in a different stage, as well. I didn't really feel like I was -- she's been struggling with her game for a while, so it can have a little bigger impact on her than it had on me last year. I just tried to block it out or just forget about it as soon as possible.","Regardless of the opponent, is that as close to being in the zone as you've been for a little while?","I mean, I played some really good matches in Sydney where I probably played even better. Movement-wise, I think today -- the ball was in my court. I was able to move her around and still really -- like I didn't feel like I was put under pressure too much by her. Balls were sitting up nice and high, in a nice position, where I was just really able to focus and dictate the points. So that's probably also why it looked easy from my side.","In that situation, 6-Love, 5-Love up, do you think maybe you should give her a game?","Give her a game? No, I mean, I do feel bad. I even caught myself like at 5-Love, she hit those couple backhands down the line, Yeah, that's it. No, seriously (laughter). Okay, when she doesn't play against me, I'm rooting for her because I want her to get back into it and build confidence. You feel when your opponent, when we're in a rally and it's going well, it's like, Yeah, this is getting better. This is where she should be. Again, that backhand down the line was the shot I remember the most about her. She didn't use it until that last game. But I wouldn't give her a game (smiling).",Do you have the same feeling in the first set in the Sydney finals against Na Li when you led 5-0?,"I led 5-2 or 5-0? I don't know. I don't think back about that. Obviously, this is a new tournament, a new start. I really don't think back about that tournament. Obviously I take the good things away for me. That was my first few matches. The feeling that I got was really good. My feeling in the final were not as good and not the way I would like to end. But obviously I had a good week there, I played some good tennis, and started off fresh here. So that's the most important thing.",UNK,UNK, 
146,8364,30450,"Sorry if the question has already been asked, now that you have switched back to your old racquet, it seems like you have found your rhythm. Tell us what made you go for a new racquet ahead of the clay court season?","No, no, no, my rhythm is not back. I won a match today. I won an important match that give me the possibility to play again tomorrow. I said when I was playing with the new racquet a few weeks ago, when you have mistakes, when you win, when you lose, it's not because of the racquet. Never. It's because of yourself. The other racquet is great. I need to adjust and practice a little bit more with that racquet. Was not enough practice before that two weeks. But I came back to that racquet because it's the racquet that today give me a little bit more confidence, a racquet that I know better than the other one. These tournaments are important for me. But I know that racquet is my future.",You've been at the highest level for an incredible amount of time. I was looking at some figures that surprised me. It's 11 years that you've been winning a major ATP clay court tournament before going to Roland Garros. Hopefully of course you aim for one victory here. How do you find after all this time your physical condition and how do you find your hunger for winning?,"Well, the physical condition today is better than in a lot of other moments in my career. That's the real thing. And the hunger to keep winning is there. The motivation to keep playing tennis, to enjoy this great tour we have and to keep having chances to compete for the events that I need to compete is a big motivation for me. I am very excited to try to change that dynamic that I am not happy with. I know dynamics are tough to change, but I know if I am working well and if I am working with the right motivation, that's going to happen. I have the conviction that that can happen, and I have decided to do everything that I can do to come back to that regular consistent level that I had for a lot of years. It's obvious that I am not 20 anymore. I have almost 29. But I feel myself enough motivation to keep going for a couple more years.","How different has this year been for you? In the past you've had injuries, but things have clicked quite quickly when you started. Obviously you found success quite quickly. Now you've had to be patient and understand things will take their time. Is there this a different sensation for you?","It's all about moments, and all the moments are different. Different feelings, different situations on the career of everyone. You have to pass all these moments. I had injuries; I had much more good than bad moments. But I had some tough moments with injuries in the past, and now I'm not injured. That's a very important point. I am on the court. If I am on the court, I have the chance to play well and win matches. Last year for six months I didn't have that chance. If I am not winning matches today, I accept. If I am not playing well enough, only thing I can do is accept, stay positive, work as much as I can, and be positive knowing that the normal thing if I had success during 11 years, why can't I have success again if I am motivated enough? I am fit; I don't have injuries; and I cannot forget to play tennis in six months.", , , , ,Yes,UNK, 
203,3713,13510,Do you think you lost the possibility of being seeded in Melbourne?,"Well, I'm certainly not going to go and play a challenger to try to become a seeded player in Melbourne. I played for the whole season here and I had my opportunities. If I'm not top 32, it will be my fault. I still have the first tournament of the year where I can win some points. I didn't really look. Yeah, I was told I had a little chance of making it. But before I had the power of doing something about it, now I don't have it anymore. So I will see next Monday what my ranking is. But anyway, I'm happy with the team I have with me. That makes me confident for next season. I know I will have the people I chose myself around me, and that we are going to do some good work. This is something positive to look forward to for the next year.","You still have team competition to play, and then you're going to the Mauritius Islands, or you don't know yet?","You forgot to talk about the holidays. Yes, team competition. Well, I'm quite disappointed this season because they changed the date of the finals and I will not be able to go and play that. What I like in team competition is that I can play those five matches with the team and we can stay together. It's really a pity, so I'm going to play this match, but I won't be able to go to the final. That is the most interesting part. Anyway, I just finished here, so I'm going to talk with my coach and the president of my club, because I really like to play with my team. I mean, all the people in the team, we asked them to come together with the president, and it's really tough not to be able to go to the end if you start playing.",Can you say a few words about your new coach? How different is he?,"Well, we started working together at the US Open. But since we started working together, we never had much time to have a long period together because there were tournaments all the time and we couldn't working on specific things. When you want to work on something specific, you need more time. So what was important for me was that he could watch me play in different circumstances on different surfaces so that he could have a real opinion about my game. Now he knows. Even if he had an idea before, now he knows exactly what I need to work on during the offseason. I really hope he's going to bring me new things for my game. I know I have to work on many things. I have a margin for progression. This is positive. This is why I chose him. And also, I know he's going to be very strict about my game and my physical training.","Going backwards, what lesson did you draw from your loss against Tsonga in the French Open, about your mental condition or...","What lessons? Well, he was just a lot better than I was for that match. The two previous rounds I had played well and I felt good playing Jo. I thought I had a chance, but he started playing extremely well from the start, from the onset, and he was above me, even mentally, during the whole match. So when you play against the top players, if they start becoming confident, it's always difficult to change it over. In the past, I saw that the beginning is extremely important when you play a top player. This is where you can have a chance, because if not, then the player starts being up and being more confident, and it becomes more difficult for you to win.", , ,Yes,Yes, 
144,20214,73438,What would you like to improve?,Definitely my net game. That would be something that I want to improve upon.,"In Mark Weil Academy, what is the best quality there? I mean, let's say that you have a young tennis player who wants to go to America. Why would you suggest to go to Mark Weil Academy?","Personal attention. Every coach cares about each player. There's not one coach there that would just, you know, not care about every single player that is at Weil Academy.",Talk about your fighting spirit. Do you think that's a real strength of yours? Could you reflect on that for a moment?,"Definitely. I think it's -- that's the main thing that pulls me through some very tough matches that I've had, in juniors and some women's tournaments. I mean, what really drives me to keep my fighting spirit and, saying, Come on, and pumping myself up on the court, is that I see all the top players doing it and obviously it must help them, because they're on the top, you know.","Tell us a little bit about your parents, who introduced you to the game. What's their background?","Well, we're originally from the Ukraine, and they have their own dog grooming business. They're self-employed, and my mom stays at home working the whole year. My dad travels with me everywhere to Mark Weil Tennis Academy, everywhere we go for tournaments, so he's like my personal coach. He's the whole, you know, the whole team put together.",Do you have any mentors out on the WTA Tour? People who you're close to?,My dad.,Yes,Yes, 
155,18355,66663,"When you called for your coach, is that partly to slow that momentum and maybe disrupt her game a bit to give yourself a breather?","Um, well, you don't get any more time when you call for a coach, but just to get a little bit -- sometimes an outsider's perspective is a little bit different than what you're seeing or thinking on the court. So, you know, sometimes from the outside you see a little bit different and you don't realize what exactly you're doing. But, yeah, for me, it's a little bit more just motivational and an energy-type of thing than anything else.","Have you had a chance to kind of step back and take an overview of this and the opportunities? I mean, Serena, she's ill and all, but she's not there anymore. Venus is not there anymore. Clijsters gets hurt. I think you're back in the top 10 with this victory, I think.",No idea.,"This is an opportunity. You're only 23 years old, and there are plenty of Grand Slams out there. You seem to be healing. Is this kind of like the time? Do you feel that? Have you thought about that? Any strategy?","Um, I don't know when a time is. I mean, I don't know if it's yesterday, today, or tomorrow. (Smiling.) I mean, I think at way I look at it is the more matches you win, whether it's here, whether it's at a Grand Slam, the better your ranking is gonna be, I mean, yeah, the further you get in a tournament. So. I don't know. I never really focus, this is my time, it's now or never. Might as well -- yeah, I don't know, jump off one of the canyons over there if you have that mentality. It's pretty tough to think like that. You just have to -- you know, even if you do feel -- sometimes you come into a tournament and you feel great and you feel like you're confident and everything's working well, hitting great in practice; sometimes you come in and those things don't quite work match in match situations. Other times you feel kind of crappy on the court, and you come in, and all of a sudden you find yourself swinging away and balls are going in and you're in a later stages of the tournament, you're loose because you didn't really expect much. It's very different. It makes the sport really unique.","What do you expect out of yourself at this point? Is it match to match, or are you looking kind of big picture?","Um, I look at the big picture, because I think it's really important to have a good perspective of where you see yourself now and where you want to see yourself. I mean, I have personal goals, of course. I still believe that I have a lot in me. That's why I, you know, fight so hard to -- you know, no matter whether it's a match or on the practice courts, I'm always trying to get better. Yeah, that's my goal right now, is to try to improve, is to try to improve. And right now's goal is I'm happy that I'm playing matches, and I just want to keep doing that on a more consistent basis and doing it on a healthy basis, as well.","Could you take a moment and try and put into words the feeling you get at that moment of triumph when you know you've won a really big tournament, Wimbledon, the U.S., Australia, that sort of ecstacy? What floods through you at that moment? Can you try and put that into words?","Um, I'm getting goosebumps. It's a special moment, because you're practicing, and when you're young it's what you dream of; it's what you see on TV. Those are the big trophies that you just dream of, whichever Grand Slam it is. Some have their favorites. And it's just a moment of -- I mean, the first thing that comes into my mind is there's days that are just so hard and you really have to really push through them. Sometimes you have to have someone that pushes you a little bit more, and it just feels so good, because you did -- you fought through. You never knew if you were going to have that chance, if you were going to have the chance to hold that trophy, but you did everything in order -- everything you did, you're not regretting. That's a good feeling to have, because it's so important, especially for younger kids. I always say you never really want to have that feeling of regret, like you had so many choices that you were never sure if that was one you wanted to follow. You know, it's a really cool -- it's an incredible feeling, yeah.",UNK,UNK, 
221,2156,7734,What sparked your interest in kinesiology?,"All my injuries, to be honest. Like every time I go to the doctor, I can pinpoint and tell him exactly what's wrong with me. I know more about my injury than they do at the time. The communication that I have is really great. I've always thought if I could just learn about my body and keep learning about physiology, sciences, stuff like that, just for the future I thought it would be really cool. You never stop learning about your body.",Have you just started the course?,"It starts on Monday the 23rd. But I had to write a paper, an introduction for my management class. So I kind of did that already. I was like, I'm going to get that over with. Trying not to send a picture of me that was so obvious.",Do you use a lot of holistic kind of therapies?,"I do. I've really gotten into a lot of holistic lately. I hate medicines. I hate having to take, you know  what's the word  medicine that's manmade and stuff like that. So I like the holistic. It's better on your system. It takes longer. But overall the effects of synthetic things are longer term and not really so good for you. I'm looking forward to those courses.",Do you use acupuncture?,I do. I use that. I think it's really cool. I actually wanted to take an acupuncture class. Hopefully I can do that. But I have to be there. I can't do that one online. I would never get any clients (laughter).,"You had acupuncture on your feet, knees?","I've had it before. I think there's a lot of results. I just like it. I think it's pretty cool. You just have to be patient. I think it's important to find a good one, though, because a lot of people do it. To do it really the Eastern way I think is right now the best way to do it, so... I have to learn by like a Japanese master, which is where one guy learned. Hopefully I can do that one day. But that would have to be after my career.",Yes,Yes, 
92,7410,27066, , , , ,Is Rafael better than ever before?,"I don't know. I think he was pretty good also before than the same like he played today and the same he was playing this week. He was like doing this six years, of course, some moments better than other ones. But if you remember Roland Garros when he beat Federer in three sets really easy, he was also playing unbelievable.",How tough was it out there?,"Yeah, no, well, of course, if you see the score, is a big difference. But in some games I had some chances to be closer, you know, to make him think a little bit more. But, you know, I think that he had unbelievable day and he played really good. He didn't let me attack him so good, with balls really high and deep. And then I also didn't have maybe a good day, no, because I was trying to force and making more mistakes than unusual.",Do you think he's back to his best level?,"Well, I think that he played really good during all the week, no? Not only today. I think he played unbelievable. And on clay, I think last year he lost against Soderling and against Federer because he was like really tired, and also with problems in the knee. If he is not with this, I think he's still the best on clay by far.",UNK,UNK, 
222,12752,46372,Is that why you were serving like in the 90s and holding back on your serve in the first set?,Was I?,Yeah.,"Oh. I don't think so. Like I said, once she came out it got better, like straightaway, and it got even better after that.",Was this a match where mental toughness was really what it was all about to win this?,"I do think it was about being mentally tough and making the right shots at the right time and just never giving up. I played a really good opponent today who has been down several match points in this tournament already, so I knew going in she wasn't just going to give it to me.","What about the fitness factor? Nearly three hours, hot afternoon, and you seemed to be strong at the end.","Yeah, no, I don't feel tired or sore or anything at all. I don't feel -- I feel like I'm really fit.

I thought they were pretty good, to be honest. I didn't go into the match thinking that I was going to lose. I went in with a lot of belief. And even though in the first set she won it 64 and was up at one point I think 51, we had some good exchanges. There was just a point here or there that was costing me the games, so...",You have clearly been hampered in your view?,"Yeah, definitely.","What are the options here? What can be done? Because that's not a small injury, the herniation. Is there some sort of a surgical procedure or something that can be done? What are your options?","I don't know. We are trying to figure it out, physios, doctors. Yeah.","Do you feel like the injury comes up more in big matches? This sort of tension in that situation, does that hurt your back?","Yeah, I think so. I think that when there is stress, stressful environment, you know, you're probably reaching for a little bit more and trying to hit it harder, trying to move in a little bit quicker, and, you know, the stress causes some problems.","When you left the court, what did they do? What was the treatment?","Peeing in a cup, doping. (Smiling.) Haven't had treatment yet.",UNK,UNK, 
42,5274,19393,"Given you took out Rafa in the quarters and I think most people thought this was your time, does this loss hurt any more than the others?","Well, you know, it's a loss. Of course it hurts, especially because it was in the finals. I think I have played a great clay court season, a great Roland Garros. You know, came to the position to really win this trophy. I was set up and was really in the match and trying to play tactically as I intended. But he just found the solutions on the court. This is sport. That's what happens on this level. You have to accept the loss.","Each time you lost here in the final you bounced back immediately in Wimbledon. Do you think it will be tougher this time, or is there something of a routine which can move on pretty quickly?","No, it's going to be very easy. I mean, it's going to Wimbledon and winning a trophy. (Laughter.) Of course it's going to be difficult. But, again, my mind is not in London at the moment, really. I just got off the court and I need some rest. That's all.","Can you just comment a bit about the end of the match? Obviously he thought he had hit an ace and it was over, and then there was like five points. How strange is that when that happens?","I had a look, I had a forehand for the break, and I missed it. If you don't use the chance once, the second one doesn't come. That's what happened.","I know you don't want to talk about Wimbledon, but will you use this defeat as motivation or will you try to forget about it as soon as possible?","Well, you were right. I don't want to talk about Wimbledon now. (Smiling.) Sorry.", , ,Yes,Yes, 
210,18899,68708,Did you say this was not your favorite event?,"No, it's not.  I don't know, I've never played very well here in the past, but the past is the past. But, you know, it's normal you think a little bit of that.  I just tried to do my best here and then we'll see match after match.  I got good preparation.  I've been a little bit sick the last couple days, hard to breathe a little bit, so I need a little bit of time to really get well in the tournament.",Is that a cold?,"Yeah, yeah, cold.","Could you talk about Vania's game?  Obviously the Americans, beyond the Williams girls, the American tennis right now is suffering a little bit.  She's one of the young up and coming ones.  Do you think she has what it takes?  What does she need to get to the next level?","Well, she's playing well.  She gave me a little bit of trouble in the first set.  She has a good backhand.  She's taking the opportunities, and she didn't look very nervous in the match.  So good qualities, but who knows what's going to happen for her in the future.  We'll see.  I. Mean, it's tough for American tennis now.  They're suffering a little bit, but I'm sure they will get good players in the future.","She says you're one of her role models, maybe because of the size similarity.  What do you say about that?","Yeah, that's good (laughing) good to hear.",You give her hope for the vertically challenged.,"I'm very proud of, not so tall, not so strong, and I compete.  I am No.1 now and I've been No.1 in the past. I could compete with the best players in the world and won Grand Slams.  It doesn't mean you have to be very powerful.  I can be powerful when I want with my technique and everything.  I can compensate a lot of things. But it's true when we are not that tall we have to be physically always 100 percent because we cannot compensate with anything, so technically and physically you have to be at your best level all the time if you want to compete.",Yes,Yes, 
66,15217,55062, , ,This year no problem with three victories for the semis.,"Yeah, I'm happy I was able to come out today and play a good, tough, solid match against a player who I thought was in good shape. I purposely didn't want to know the calculations before today's match, whereas I was in the loop very clearly what I kind of needed to do last year, which I think played on my mind a little bit. So I think, thanks to what happened last year, I was better prepared this year. But I was also playing first up this time around, which then obviously still maybe needs some time to wait for me with the Murray match tonight. I just wanted to come out and try to play as good a match as I can. Losing is never a solution to trying to win a tournament. That's why I'm happy that all three matches, straight sets, not wasted any energy. I'm playing real well. I'm through to the semis. So it's all real good right now.",Obviously winning this event in itself is a big thing. Is there also a sense with you that you want to put down a marker as well in terms of next year to show that you're going to be right in there sort of breathing down Rafa's neck?,"Well, I think regardless if I win here or not, I'm one of the big contenders with Rafa and other guys trying to win the big tournaments. But obviously this would just help on - how do you say - a level starting the season great in Australia, finishing the season great in London would be, you know, the circle is sort of closed. Then again, I'm still two matches away, two really tough matches. I'm most likely going to play against top-five guys. Depends who I play, I don't even know yet. It's going to be a tough weekend ahead of me. That's my focus right now. So far it's been good, you know. I won against top-10 players in straight sets. That's going to make me feel obviously awfully good for the weekend. But I hope I can keep it up. Tournament's not over yet. This is really when it starts for me.",Your thoughts about meeting Maradona? We know he requested specifically to come to London to meet you. What did you say?,"He was very nice. Very supportive. Big admirer of mine it seemed like. It was a great pleasure for me to meet someone who I think has an incredible life behind him already, and he's still got hopefully a lot to look forward to in the future. Obviously he's one of the best soccer players of all time, which I grew up admiring as well, you know, to a certain degree, even though him being from South America, obviously I always preferred European player. I still think he's probably in the top three of all time. It was a big pleasure for me to meet him. I already signed a shirt once for him. Finally we got to meet. It was nice. I heard a lot of things through Del Potro, Nalbandian, and Gaudio. So it was a big pleasure for me.","We heard last year you didn't win Swiss sports personality, year after becoming the greatest champion of all time. What are your chances of winning it this year?",No chance.,Yes,Yes, 
90,12081,44080,What did it say?,Just well done for winning at Queen's and good luck here was the gist of it.,Have you had any other interesting letters from people that you didn't expect?,"No. I mean, I don't read that much of the stuff during Wimbledon. But that one, someone from the All England Club came and gave it to me at the end of one of my practices. So obviously I was going to open it. He told me who it was from, and then I...","I don't know if you heard, but had you a proposal of marriage at some stage during that match. Are you comfortable with receiving that sort of attention?","Uhm, well, I mean, I guess each time you play on Centre Court, I mean, everyone -- a lot of people shout out different things to, I guess, I don't know, make the crowd laugh. I don't know what it's for. But, uhm, just try and block it out when you're playing. I mean, yeah, I don't really know what to say. I mean, it's happened a couple of times at Wimbledon, but haven't accepted any yet.","You said at the end of last year you had two ambitions. One was to win Wimbledon and the other was to pass your driving test. Have you had any time to having any driving lessons, and have you taken your test yet?","No. I'm going to try to do it after Wimbledon. Obviously I've been very busy this year. You know, it's a relatively stressful thing to do at the end of a long training day, to take driving lessons, especially with the traffic and stuff in London. So I haven't had time to do it yet, but maybe after Wimbledon.",The day before yesterday you talked about the roof. Did you notice the roof again? Did it trouble you at all?,"I mean, it was better today because of the clouds. You don't see it quite as much. You know, when I came off court, you know, my first match, uhm, the guys that were sitting in my box were saying it was really, really tough for them to see. The sun was -- I mean, the sun's always bright, but it seemed -- they said it was really difficult for them to see. There was a glare. You know, today was better because of the clouds. But it just comes over a different angle, you know, the shadow on the court. But it was better today.",UNK,UNK, 
119,8732,31846,"When you have a day off, do you feel 100% almost? If you played next day you wouldn't be 100%, but if you play two days later you're almost 100%?","Yeah. I mean, no reason not to be. And tomorrow -- I think tomorrow morning I can already be 100% practicing. During the off-season, it was much tougher. You know, I would finish the day at 9:00 in the evening, and next morning at 9:00 in the morning I have already to be on the court and giving my 100% and I had even less time to recover. That's why we have a base that we build everything to be ready for any situation during the tournament.",Do you feel all the talk about nonsense - I won't even say what it is - but does the crowd or people here give you a lot of support? People say things to you to sort of encourage you?,"Well, of course. Actually, they support me a lot, you know. I really like to play here. And of course I think it helps that my brother won here. They love, I guess, our family. So I want them to cheer for me. You know when you are playing on the court and you're fighting, maybe in some stages you're not playing your best, but you still here the crowd supporting you and just gives you another edge. You want to play for them and win for them. They come the next day and support you.","Your brother and many others have talked about the difficulties of living up to expectations when you are the top player in the world, man or woman. You're No.1 by way of being, in large part, I think nine finals that you have' been in this year. Now, do you feel that that just having those -- the fact that you've made it to nine finals on different surfaces, does that give you tremendous confidence in your ability to progress here over the course of a two-week tournament?","Of course. You know, let's say last year I started only from the half year. But this year I proved that I can play on all surfaces. I made semifinal Wimbledon when I never pass the second week. So it just shows me that I can play on all surfaces. This gives me a lot of confidence when I step on the court and I know that I'm -- you know, beat me. I'm ready for you.","As he mentioned though with all the controversy that has gone on, what was going through your mind at the end of that first set when you found yourself down a set?","Well, I've been down a set also in the first round. There are still two sets more to play.","I'm sure you love to win 6-2, 6-1, whatever. Is there a part of you that just has to say, Okay, I'm going to have this drama. It's going to be three sets. It's gonna be crazy. It's going to be double faults, but I'll get through it. Is there a part of you that has to sort of embrace it and say, Let's go?","Well, it's basically because today was exactly the same situation as first round. Again 5-3 up, against serve, 6-5 against set points. I don't want to play three sets. Don't think that I want to lose the first set and then, you know, being again break down in the third set and I fight through. Well, it just -- I have to be more disciplined. Here is okay, 5-3, and there is no more talking. I have to close the set. So, you know, I will work on it, and we'll make sure it's going to be two sets.",Yes,Yes, 
142,21366,77613,"Did you feel special memories on the court, Here I got the trophy, or, Here I lie on my back?","I have enough work to think about two years ago. When I go on court, I think about the opponent and about play my best tennis. No, I don't have time to think about another things, no.",What did you think of Spain last night?,"Much better, I think. Well, much better. I think the first day we had probably not our best match. But we didn't play bad. And we lost, no? We were, I think, very unlucky. And yesterday we were unlucky, too, I think, because we had to win 5-0, not 2-0.",Did you watch Roger's game yesterday?,For moments. Not all the match.,What did you think?,"Well, it was close, so... Sure, always the first round I tell you is very difficult. Normally for him are easier than for the rest of the other players because he plays like his normal tennis here on grass. He needs to adapt his game less than the rest of the players. But Falla is a great player. Well, he had his chance. I think he wasn't play his best tennis in the moment that he need to play his best tennis to win. You know, you play against probably the best of the history on this surface, and for sure going to be a very important win for his confidence, I think.",Which one of his records do you think is his most impressive?,"Every one. Every one is amazing. If I have to say something, 23 semifinals in a row of Grand Slam.",Yes,Yes, 
262,15335,55516,"I think this is very important tough competition in professional career because you have a competition with another Chinese player. Some people say that if you can make through this match, you are gonna have next milestone in your professional career. Actually today we noticed Carlos didn't go to the court to talk to you during the match. Will you bother to give us explanation why? Even you have very tough competition, you didn't ask Carlos to go to the court to discuss with you.","I don't think this is the most important match in my professional career. If the most important one I prefer to regard is French Open as most important one. This is just another win of this tournament at all. If you believe it is the most important and most tough one, definitely when a newspaper is going to come out, definitely you will write a script like that. Actually, when I finished the Tokyo tournament, I discuss with Carlos that Carlos will not go to the court to coach me until it is very much necessary. I personally believe that I can control the match today. Otherwise I will definitely ask, you know, Carlos to give me coach there.","If Bartoli fail to be champion in China Open, definitely you will be qualifying to play for WTA final. So can you share with us your expectation for your preparation for WTA final?","Actually, whether Bartoli will win or not has nothing to do with me. I can't expect to be qualify for WTA because Bartoli failed. I can't control the WTA final. What I am going to control is control myself on the match. Anyway, you know, WTA final is only eligible for the top eight. This is achievement for all the players who have made a very important achievement in the past season. I'm going to try to take an important vacation after this one.","Every time when we talk about the young or junior players you are not very much confidant for them. Today Ze Zhang is competing with Gasquet. Will you bother to make comments on the significance of this match? Because in China it's not easy first to have excellent, you know, Chinese male player as you are in Top 10.","Actually, a lot of people ask me why in China we only have female competent players but not male competent players. I would say probably the male players in China prefer to choose table tennis, as a joke. Then I would say that they havent woken up. Today Im happy that Ze Zhang beat a Top 20 player in China. I think that's very important, a significant match for him, and he's going to gain more confidence in his professional career. If he failed to win Gasquet today, probably he's going to be a little bit negative towards the match. Its a big step for him to win this match.","Before you participate in this match, does your coach give you specific guidance to be prepared for Peng Shuai, or does Peng Shuai give you some unexpected things during the match?","How to say it, actually, Carlos didn't have a very good understanding of Peng Shuai. We will not change our plan simply because of a match. You know, Carlos only concentrate on myself. We just do as what we did in past three, you know, matches.","My question is following the previous question. Zhang Shuai wanted to take the professional player and play as individual player. I want to ask you that. You know, everybody knows Zhang Shuai's personality. For the other players like Zhang Shuai, if they're going to try to play as individual player, do you think how much opportunity will be given, what kind of practice will be given to Zhang Shuai?","I will tell you that I can't answer that question, because I'm not Zhang Shuai. I dont know her personality, neither her experience. It's better for you to ask Zhang Shuai those questions.",Yes,Yes, 
268,16166,58610,You're now on your longest run on grass. Your last run was 'sHertogenbosch coming into today. What has been the difference between two years ago and now?,"Well, a lot of things now, I'm more a player, a tennis player (smiling), in enough aspects. I grow so much mentally. I'm tougher now. Technically I also improve a lot. I'm stronger now. In two years you have a lot of time to improve a lot of things. Also I learned more how to play on grass than before.","Speaking of mental toughness, the momentum seemed to shift significantly in the second set. You got it back again. Can you describe how you managed to regain your composure there?","Well, I think I was 61, 31. I was like, What? I was playing really good. I was like, Okay, wait. You're the only one that can lose this match. I just get really nervous. And I think Radwanska, you know, she was waiting for this moment. She was like, Okay, she's playing good. I'm going to wait to see if she can handle this situation. She did good. She fight. She won the second set. But I was, Okay, be calm. You're playing against Agnieszka. It's going to be a tough match. In the third, I could find a way, as in the first set, you know, play more aggressive, lose the fear to win the match.","Did she change the tactics on you, try to make you run more? What did you feel she was doing differently?","Well, I think I let her do more things 'cause I went like one step behind. I had this on my stomach. You know, when you let the other ones play, you're going to start to run. I think that was it.","Last year after your win against Serena in Paris, someone was asking you if you are more famous in Venezuela or Spain. You said, I'm not famous at all. Same question now.","I don't know. I mean, in Venezuela, I don't have how to know if people follow me because I don't go there. In Spain, well, you know, step by step, there's a lot of big players in Spain, especially in the men's side. So it's hard to get through there, you know.","How would you describe Serena Williams, and what would be the challenge for you if it is Serena in the final?","I think is the best final you can play. You know, to have Serena in the Wimbledon final I think is the hardest match you can have. If you want to win a Grand Slam, when you dream, you say, I want Serena in the final. She's like one of the best players in all these years. So it's obviously I think the best challenge to have.",UNK,UNK, 
206,10821,39400,Which way?,Up. Higher. Because I was way down with the other one.,To what exactly?,"22 kilos before; now I'm up to like 25, 26.","Tennis these days obviously is such a power game; there is also a lot of grace in the game. It's almost an art form, you could say. You have your beautiful onehanded backhand; your forehand has a lot of flow; you move with grace. Could you just talk about the grace in the game, the beauty of the game, and sort of what for you is key? Is it balance? The legs? The reflexes? The anticipation? Just talk about that, please.","To win, you mean?","I'm talking about the grace of your game, the grace in tennis, whether you see it in part as a kind of thing of beauty or art form.","Well, it's nice. It's somewhat possible it's nice that tennis players usually find their way to sort of nice to watch, easy to watch, please the eye kind of thing. So for me that's something that's also enjoyable to watch as a spectator. Then do you need it to win? Not necessarily. I mean, brutal is fine, too, as long as you get the victory. I think that's what matters at the end of day for the fans and for the players itself. But I'm happy that my game is pretty graceful, like it's got a flow, like you say. I have been able to have the movement which allows me to play for a long time. I think that, for me, is the most important. Then if it looks good, it's honestly the second priority. As long as it's a movement that I can live with for a long time on tour, you know. That's something I guess in some ways I perfected, and I'm happy it's been the right choice and the right direction I went into over 10, 15 years ago.",Do you have a kind of pride in your onehanded backhand that you have such variety in it?,"Well, I mean, I just really try to do what I can. Sure, I try to hit hard and with topspin and with slice, but usually it's because I have to. It's not like by choice all the time. I get put under a lot of pressure on my backhand side throughout my career, so clearly I have better days than worse days. At the moment my backhand seems like it's doing pretty good, even though today I must say it's pretty quick conditions out there. The ball flies on you and it's hard to see with the glare on the back of the court where the guy is going to serve on the first serve. And also when he plays a lot of topspin the ball bounces a lot, so it's a bit more difficult to control the ball right now.",UNK,UNK, 
238,19714,71522,"You've played Ilhan, I think. Did you play him in Australia?","Yeah, I did.","It's a sort of dangerous tie, isn't it, would you say?","It is, yeah. Ilhan is a solid player, very good player. He's actually very close breaking top 100. I think so far he's had a very good year. I lost to him this year, the Open, second round quallies. I don't know about the second player at all. I don't know who it is, but definitely Ilhan is definitely a player that's capable of winning good matches.","Can I just verify, you said your conversation with Leon, you think that led directly to you not getting welcome?","He just said if I wasn't playing Davis Cup I'm not gonna get the wildcard for LTA events, which was here and I think Eastbourne. I think the All England Club makes the decision for Wimbledon.", , , , ,UNK,Yes,UNK?
46,11634,42465,"It seems like against Roger now you're playing on your terms. You're pretty much in control of the entire match if you're playing at your top level, which is a pretty tough thing to do against him. Talk a little bit about that.","Yeah. Well, the one thing I tried to explain to a few people, like a year or so ago, is that, you know, people say, Oh, you play very defensively. You didn't hit the ball particularly hard all the time, or whatnot. You lose a lot of the matches by letting guys sort of dictate the points. But you know, trying to explain that there's more than one way of dictating points. It's not just going for big, booming serves all the time and huge forehands. If you change the pace with the ball a lot, you know, and mix it up, you know, makes your guy -- I'm playing the match how I want it to go. If I started trading big groundstrokes with someone like Federer, I think he likes that. I haven't done it against him, and I don't do it against many people. That's my game style. Very rarely do I lose matches having let the other guy play his natural game.",There was a lot of anticipation toward a Federer/Nadal final. How does it feel to ruin those plans?,"Doesn't really bother me, to be honest. Every time I play Roger I feel like I got a shot to win. You know, I'm sure a lot of people would like to see Roddick in that final now. Maybe I definitely wasn't thinking about that during the match.","Are you still practicing Bikram yoga, and how much do you attribute your fitness and focus to this?","I did it in the off-season quite a lot. I don't do it that much throughout the year, because you get very dehydrated doing it. It's very hot, so you need to make sure that going in, you're hydrated. When you come out, it takes, you know, two, three hours before you're feeling normal again. So I do it a little bit in the off-season when I have time to recover and whatnot. But I don't do it that much during the year.",That's six times out of eight you've gotten a piece of Roger. How would you rate your all-round performance today?,"I mean, it was good. I lost my concentration a bit at the start of the second set. You know, managed to get myself back into the match -- into the second set, sorry. It was good. I don't think I did anything incredible, but that wasn't what I was trying to do when I went in to play the match.",Can you talk about playing the finals tomorrow and facing either Andy or Rafa?,"Both are obviously very tough. Rafa won the first set, but -- I mean, Roddick has always been very tough in the States. He loves playing in front of his home crowd, and it will be obviously tough against him. I've got a good record. Nadal, I've started to play better against him lately, but he's obviously one of the toughest players ever. I have to play some of my best tennis.",No,No, 
77,6482,23751,Will you be watching tonight?,"I think a little bit. I might watch, come here and watch a little bit.",How do you think Jelena will go against Dinara?,"I don't know. I think it's going to be very tough and a very interesting match. All players are very tough in the quarterfinals, so you never know what's gonna happen out there. I hope they will have a good match. I'm really looking to my semifinal.",Seems to be a very open tournament. Have you thought about the possibility of winning it?,"You know, if I'm coming for the tournament, I'm pretty confident in myself. If I'm in the tournament, I'm here to try to win it. But I'm really concentrating on every match. For me, it doesn't really matter what's happening around any other matches. I just try to concentrate on myself as much as possible, try to improve match to match because I know I need it. That's why I'm just looking forward for the next one, not thinking about anything else.","Marion's take on today was that you just played amazing tennis, it was all down to you. Is that how you saw it or were you surprised you didn't get a better fight?","No, I think I played very good tennis. I think Marion been playing very good as well, but I was able to play very clean match today. I think that's what made the difference. Like I said, in the beginning I made a few unforced errors and I was down, because Marion wasn't giving me any opportunities. And as soon as I was able to play a very, very clean match, and it's happening not that often, and I'm very satisfied about it today.",How tough is it to keep playing at that level? Is it difficult to retain your concentration in that situation?,"I think it always looks much easier from the side. It was very tough and very close. I think every point, we both were fighting as hard as we can. It's just today it happened I was able to be a little bit better than her. But we'll see what's gonna happen in the next match.",Yes,Yes,unk?
68,8062,29378,Are you a bit stunned after something like this or just down?,"I don't think 'stunned' is the right word. You know, I don't view what happens today as an impossibility. I take every match very seriously. You know, I don't know. I always struggle with how to describe my mood. I mean, there's only so many ways you can say it. So, you know, I'm sure you can use your intuition and reach out and come up with something.","After the fourth-set breaker, where he got a little bit nervous, you had a couple big serves, thought that maybe in the fifth he'd tighten up a bit. He hasn't been in that position. What were you expecting going into the fifth?","Uhm, you know, honestly if you would have told me I hit the ball like I did in the fifth, I would have liked my chances at the end of the fourth. Credit to him, because I got into some games. I make him hit a good pass on breakpoint. He stuck a volley. He hadn't taken a first ball and came in all day and he did it down breakpoint. He played high-risk, but he executed very well. You know, he had a game plan, he stuck to it, and he deserved to win more than I did. That's for sure.",Any reason why you felt you were down in the first three sets in terms of quality?,What's the question?,Any reason why you were not hitting the ball that well in the first three sets?,"If I would have had a reason, I probably would have figured it out, right? It didn't feel clean. It didn't feel good.",Was he controlling too much real estate where you couldn't get into net as many times as you wanted to?,"It's tough to come in against a ball that stays low and flat like that. You need some time to set and go. You know, you get him on a surface that is conducive to his swings, he can keep the ball down. It's tough charging off of a ball that's not coming off the ground too much. So, yeah, I mean, he did a good job of, like I said, controlling the middle of the court. You know, if I was through the middle, he was getting length and driving the ball.",UNK,UNK, 
75,15859,57571,"No, no, but I mean as it...","As it went on, yeah, I was kind of finding myself out there, and I was feeling good and, you know, mellow and calm and relaxed.",What surprised you about him and what impressed you most?,"Um, I guess like the surprising thing is that backhand chip. He kind of -- he does a great job of just going over there and really just kind of getting balls back and getting balls back. For the most part, they're pretty deep. It's tough, because he gives you that chip and he almost tempts you to come in. You can't just come in on any ball against him. You have to put it pretty much in one of the corners, otherwise he's going to pass you. Sometimes if you put it in one of the corners he's going to pass you. He's kind of just edging you on a little bit. It's tough to deal with.","Could you talk a little bit about what you think the cause of the nerves was at the outset? Was it the opponent or the setting, the whole...","Well, I think a little bit of both. More of the setting. My first time on Ashe, and it was pretty windy at the beginning. It was kind of windy the whole match, but especially the beginning. It was really windy and my heart was racing for the first hour. You know, also, too, playing Rafa. He's -- the last six months he's lost like one match, so it was kind of a combination.",The crowd really got behind you. Did you become aware of that?,"Yeah, I heard them, especially that 4-2 game. They were into it. They wanted that one more than I did, probably. (laughter.)",Who were the Samurai warriors in your box?,"Four of my friends flew out, took the red eye last night, and they're going back. Shane Poppen and Chap Way, Dan Farrugia and Wes Burrows all flew out.", Yes,Yes, 
216,7010,25593,So you just sat there and watched them bowl?,"Oh, yeah, waddled my way out there.",Do you ever feel bad for an opponent when you're beating them that quickly and easily?,No.,"On the plays down the stretch though you had an opportunity to challenge a call that was borderline.  I mean, if it were closer would you have challenged, or did the score dictate that?","Well, sometimes in the court you can see the marks of the ball.  That helps a lot, especially here because the surface.  It's blue, and when the ball hits it and -- not always, but you can see the marks.  Because there are so many marks you usually don't know which one it is. Sometimes if it's a fresh mark you know that that's where the ball landed and you can see if it was on the line or not.  If it's really close then challenge, and if not then you don't.",You didn't determine not to challenge because the score was so lopsided?,"No, because I saw the ball was in.  It showed on the screen it was almost inside the line, so...","When you get all dressed up for the nighttime at the US Open, does it do anything to you psychologically almost like when you're going out for a big evening out and you dress up and it pumps you up for the night?  When you come out, is that part of the whole...","I was trying to get through my warmup as fast as I could so I could put the dress on actually.  Not a joke.  Was pretty excited about putting it on. So I told my coach, I was like, Last return and I'm out of here.  I'm going in the locker room.",Yes,UNK,YES?
277,15466,55961, , ,The difficulty in terms of your movement and ankle?,"The grass is for sure harder than the clay for the ankles because there's a bit more grip on the surface. There's a lot more short, sharp reaction, reaction, so you need to place your feet really well. And always, the first few days on any grass court, it's pretty slippy out there. You have to be careful. I watched a few of the matches. Guys were slipping down. So I was really concentrating hard on my movement. I actually thought I moved reasonably well.","Was he more maybe difficult than you thought, dealing with the ankle and the grass and change and stuff like that?",I knew it was difficult because I had a few problems in practice. But it's just so little time to get ready for it. That was really the first true test on the grass to put it through. It was okay.,"Can you talk us through when we last saw you in Paris when you first tried it, how it felt, what any doctors or physios said to you?","Actually I just saw a doctor now. Straight after the match in Paris, I got home, got straight on the Eurostar, and then took the following day off, trying to ice it four or five times a day. Sunday I came into practice and it rained, so it was indoors. But it was just really, really light, what I did. And then, yeah, Monday I practiced for an hour and a half, two hours, did a bit of movement work on the court and felt decent, felt all right. Then obviously yesterday I had the doubles and practiced, played some singles points before the doubles and was feeling pretty sore, so I went into the doubles match using the tape, whereas in practice I was playing with the brace. It's just a lot of decisions to make in terms of the best thing to use for it, because at the French I ended up using very little on it, but here I felt like I needed a brace or some strapping.",How did the brace feel?,"Well, I've used the same one on my left side, but I've never had a problem with my right ankle ever. So it just feels different. If you're used to running and with your orthotics and nothing else, then you put a big ankle brace in there, it feels a bit different, takes a few days to get used to.",Yes,No, 
45,95,316,"Start of the week looking ahead, very strong field here. Realistically what was your goal? How far did you see yourself going here?","I didn't set a, like a round, quarters, or semis or anything like that. I just wanted to go out there and play with a good attitude and play level-headed and work on hitting my forehand inside out more than inside in, which I did a great job of all week. I just really wanted to focus on my service games the whole week, which I did a great job of. I think I only lost serve maybe like three times this week. I was more worried about my attitude and the way I played rather than how far I got in the tournament.",A win like this must give you a lot of confidence giving to Wimbledon?,"Definitely. You know, I'm playing great on the grass, and now I've got a week to practice and regroup. Then I'm looking forward to Wimbledon next Monday.",Is Wimbledon sort of forming as a possibility in your mind? Do you see yourself as a future Wimbledon champion now?,"I mean, I'd love to win Wimbledon. I'm kind of going with baby steps here and try and make the third round this year, because the second round is the best I've ever done there. You know, it's possible, but I think I've still got some work to do, and there's still some great competitors out there you have to beat to win a Wimbledon title.",What do players think of Federer losing today in Germany? Does that perhaps give you hope or do you think that's maybe just a blip?,"Not really. I mean, he's still Roger Federer. He's lost early -- he's lost matches before and come back the next week and gone on to win events plenty of times in his career. I think guys are still gonna fear him. He's still the most feared player at Wimbledon even though he lost today to Lleyton. Maybe he's lost a little bit of his game, but he's still -- he's still, you know, the greatest player ever and the defending Wimbledon champion and the guy that -- you know, I definitely am gonna fear him more than any player.","If there is one area of your game that you think you can improve on, what would it be, do you think?","I think my return of serve can get much better, because my service games -- I hold serve most of the time. I think I lost serve, like I said, three or four times this week, so that allows me on the return games to take more chances. I think I need to start doing that, especially on the second serves. I think I could step up in the court in front of the baseline, take some swings at the ball. Even if you fly it 10 feet long, it's still -- you still let the opponent know, hey, I'm gonna take some cuts out there. You know, I think it will -- it will intimidate the opponent a little bit.",Yes,UNK, 
111,12239,44601,It hasn't been easy for you lately. How does it feel to be at the top again?,"Yeah, it's a very good feeling to sort of have these kind of sensations on court, to be getting this confidence through match wins. At the end of the day, it's work I've been putting in on court long before my first match here, long before Washington. I felt like I was doing a lot of good work. It's nice to see the pieces coming together.",How do you explain the difference between a couple months ago and how you're playing right now?,"Hard work and things coming together. I have found a lot of solutions. I wouldn't necessarily call them distractions, but there were a lot of things on my mind a certain part of the year. I think I've sort of found peace within all of that. I've been able to focus on my tennis and get that together.","The neck thing, is that something that is going to be a concern for tomorrow and possibly after that for the rest of this tournament?","I think it's something we can get under control quite a bit by tomorrow. I don't think it's something that's going to disappear necessarily. But it is a tight muscle that's inflamed. If we can sort of calm that down, I think it's going to help significantly lower the pain and the discomfort in my arm. Tomorrow's another day. I don't know. I could sleep well and it could be something really good, or I could have a bad sleep.",Did it just come up today?,I've had it a few days. But today was the first day that the antiinflammatory didn't work.,It's a quick turnaround for tomorrow. You're on at 2 p.m. You've always played during the night. Would you have preferred to play during the night?,"No, it's okay. Normally for me daytime is better. It's normally a quicker situation. It's going to be a little bit different tomorrow. But it's not a situation I feel uncomfortable in.",UNK,No,may be unk
60,8421,30666,What do you expect from your final opponent?,"I expect her to be a really tough opponent because, uhm, number one, she's a really good grass-court player. She's proven that last year getting to the semifinals. She's also a lefty, which I've said before on grass is very tricky. You know, she's using her serve really well. And, yeah, it will be tough. She's been playing really good tennis.",How much can you take it easy on yourself in matches mentally if you're not playing well?,Compared to when or just in general?,"You're in a match, not playing well, not going well on the day. Are you thinking that you can't believe you're playing so bad? Are you kicking your own butt mentally?","A little bit. I mean, you have to. You have to give yourself a little push, whether it's in the butt or somewhere else, in the head, I don't know. Yeah, you got to find a way to get going in a way, but you also have to find a sense of calmness, as well. Because if you get too ahead of yourself, then that's a recipe for disaster.","When you give up your serve on a double-fault in the semifinal and then you do it again and then you do it again, potentially that's a very dispiriting experience. What is the mental process you go through to override that each time?","Yeah, well, considering that I didn't serve well and I was playing someone, you know, that's been serving extremely well at this tournament, you know, I'm really happy that I won the match not only in two sets, but I was able to break her a lot. I think that shows the fact that I, you know, did some other things right. So at the end of the day that's the most important thing.","How, if at all, has your relationship with your dad changed now that he's just your dad and not also your coach?","Uhm, I don't tell him to be quiet that often anymore (laughter). No. I mean, at the end of the day he's still my father and he's someone that knows me the best as anyone's ever going to know me - my mom, as well. I've always had a really good relationship with my dad. When things wouldn't go well on the court or we'd have an argument at the end of the day, we always ended with laughs at a dinner table. We'd go on to other things, or my mom would be pushing me for homework, to do my stuff. So it's a pretty nice relationship to have.",Yes,Yes, 
217,20479,74447,You lost your focus.,Yeah.,Evans is coming off a good run. He beat Nieminen. Have you registered at all what he's been doing? There are an awful lot of guys playing like that.,"Well, Everyone can play. Hit with guys 300 in the world they hit the ball as well as a guy top 30. It's surprising how players can play. It's just a matter of  the match is very different. Obviously he must have played very well to beat Kei. He's had very good results on grass. I think he likes grass over all the surfaces. I don't know too much about him. I watched him a lot, but obviously I need to, because he beat a very good player today.","Given all the controversy about Andy Roddick's match last year, do you feel like you proved a point today in this gutsy performance?","Definitely. To turn any match around like thiswhere I think I was probably one or two points away from being out of the tournament, being able to turn that around and find something inside you to win this match was very, very good for me, and, you know, I take that as confidence into my next round. You know, I'm going to approach it with a lot of confidence. That's the important thing.", , , , ,Yes,Yes, 
143,11865,43255,How has anything changed for you since Wimbledon till now?,"Everything changed.  First of all, of course, my ranking.  Ranking changed a lot because you have usually some byes into the draw, you're getting later into the draw. Of course, everybody knows me now.  I have to do more distraction outside of tennis.  I like it.  Otherwise I play really good.  I feel my tennis is really clicking together and I'm playing really well.  So this is the most important.",Have you been able to do anything enjoyable while in New York?  Opportunities you may not have had before?,"Usually I take those opportunities after the tournament.  When the tournament is finished, yes, I have some time off.  I'm really a shopping lover, so I have a lot of things to do in New York for this. But, you know, I make it when the tournament is finished.  So I hope in two weeks for me now.",Are you doing anything interesting?,"I'm usually going to Time Square Garden, see one show, have some fun, go to the restaurants.  And, of course, do a lot of shopping.",Nice way to start a Grand Slam tournament.,"Yeah, of course, you know, I think she was a little scary maybe.  I don't know if she played the US Open before in the woman's draw.  When I was a wildcard, I was playing the French Open, I remember I was really scared every time I was playing on court. I think she was the same today.  But, you know, she can hit the ball pretty well and she can serve hard, and I think my game was just right enough to beat her in an hour or so.",Talk about the way you feel about this environment at the US Open.,"The US Open, right way the first time I played it in '01 in the juniors, I won the juniors there.  I feel so great the first time I played there. Each year it's happen something great to me, either in singles or in doubles here.  Something came out, came out always with a good result in singles or in doubles.  So I really love this, to play in those courts. First of all, the surface is fast and I like it.  The atmosphere, you know, stay in Manhattan, you can quit a bit from tennis and then you're coming back, you turn it on again when you're in Flushing Meadows.  Those kind of breaks between the two, I like it also. It's just a nice tournament for me to play and I really enjoy to be in New York.",Yes,Yes, 
30,17520,63490,And then Marion actually won the final game. Do you think that will help you when you look back on it?,"Definitely. I think the crowd also helped me a lot in that moment. Everybody, when they just got up and applause and tried to get me back into it, they actually did. They gave me the energy also to get back into it and try everything. Obviously, after those two weeks, having so many hard matches is draining in the end of the day. I think Marion was fresher today. I think that made a big difference, too.",In the fifth game of the second set you seemed to put your racquet to your face. There was a lot of pressure on you. You got very emotional. Can you tell us what was running through your mind at that point?,"Not pressure. For me, there was no pressure. It was just I was a bit sad that I couldn't perform the way I can. So that was basically it.","I felt like I wanted a bit more after it finished. You'd been playing two weeks, and it comes down to about 90 minutes. Do you think the threeset format is showing the best of women's tennis?",I think for us it's good. I really like that we're playing the third set out with no tiebreak. I think that's very good. I think they should keep it that way.,Do you think there should be a fiveset final?,"Not necessarily, no.",What were your thoughts when Marion put her arm on your shoulder as you were walking off?,"Well, we're good friends. We've known each other for a while. We had some tough matches. You know, it was good to play against her. She deserves it. She's been on tour for so long. I'm happy for her. I'm disappointed, but I'm happy for her, as well. I hope that I'll get the chance to go one further one day, as well.",Yes,Yes, 
22,12243,44612,"There were a couple of moments when it looked as if you were really getting stuck in there, and then suddenly there would be a mishit. Do you find that the conditions here are something you need to get used to, the altitude or the way the ball bounces? Because you were going into the shot, and then suddenly you saw it going somewhere else and there was a little scream from you, like, Ah.","Yeah, I don't know what it was. Sometimes it's movement; sometimes it's a bad bounce. There is nothing you can control. It's the same conditions for everybody. I came here a little bit early and tried to get the feel, but there is nothing you can practice a year or whatever. It's not going to make a difference until you play a real match. That's what's good for me, to feel that environment in the match. So we'll see how it goes. I can only pick it up from here.",Recently there has been a bit of controversy with Sloane and Serena. Don't know if you heard.,Uhuh.,Have you ever had any bad experiences around the locker room with players?,With bad players?,With any players.,"No, not really. I'm trying to be friendly and respectful with everybody. We're all big family who travel all together. You see all the girls pretty much every week, so, no, never had any problem really.", , ,UNK,UNK, 
24,7907,28794,"Today in the second set, in the fourth game, you yelled out during a point.",I what?,There was a notable yell from you during a point.,Okay. I think you can always hear that from me.,I've never heard you do it before. Do you remember the point? You were hitting a lob; before Pervak hit it you yelled. It was a sort of noise.,I don't know. I remember something that I was on the run and kind of like tried to stretch out.,Were you in pain at all? Did you do anything? Is that why you yelled? Something jarred in your leg?,"No, it was just very tough position to recover from. You know, kind of just helped me to get over it. But I didn't feel like there was something exceptional.","Sloane Stephens was saying yesterday she thinks as great as Serena is, that it's inevitable that her winning streak will eventually end. Do you feel that way?",I don't really care about that.,UNK,UNK, 
127,7684,28094,First out last year and first in semifinals this year. Do you feel happy right now with the breakthrough of this year?,"Yeah, for sure I'm happy. It's a great achievement for me, going through the semifinals, of course, which kind of gives me a relief of the upcoming match. But as I said on the court, every match is important, so I will try to win against Tsonga even though we both have not much to lose. I already qualify and he has no chance of qualifying, so result-wise it's not really important. But as I said, every match is crucial here.",What went through your mind at the start of the second set? Obviously a big difference to what went on in the first set.,"Well, I was quite nervous and a bit shaky on the start of the match, in the first set and the second set as well. I was a break down already on the first service games I played. This is something that shouldn't be happening that often, especially at events like that. But I managed to come back, and I'm just happy to win the matches like this. Davydenko is a really difficult opponent wherever you play him. He stays close on the baseline and likes to play aggressive. If he's in a good rhythm, then he's one of the toughest opponents on the tour. He was stepping in and using his opportunities, but I just wasn't myself in that second set and I lost that desire and played very bad. So losing the set 6-Love is not a good thing if you're coming into the third set. I was a bit lucky in 1-0 in the third set, but then served well in the important moments. That's all that matters.","After the first match you said you learned so much from last year, even though you didn't win a match. Could you please elaborate a bit? What did you learn from last year's experience, because we see a big difference between two years?","I learned I shouldn't lose that many matches. But every event you play and every match you play is a new experience and a new challenge, and you just have to accept it that way and take the best out of it. So last year wasn't that much fun for me, haven't won a single set. But I gained that experience. It's different this year, because I'm coming here as a Grand Slam winner and more matured player, stronger mentally and physically on the court. When you have more confidence and believe more in yourself, and of course, you're physically well-rested and fit for challenges, then things are going more smoothly.","Some comments or your next opponent, Tsonga, because he's at edge of repeating what you have been through last year. I'm sorry we keep talking about that.","Yes, well, he certainly doesn't want to finish the way I finished last year. He was a bit unlucky in those two matches, lost 7-6 in the third and now two tiebreaks today. He was playing well, but just in the certain moments he made some unforced errors, so he certainly is unhappy a little bit. But on the other hand, he's been struggling with injuries a little bit, and physically he's maybe a bit tired playing, winning Bercy. But I know what's the feeling. Last year I lost the first two matches. I lost any chance of qualifying for semifinals, but I wanted to win that third match, and I'm expecting the same thing from him.","I'm just wondering what your thoughts are on the financial crisis and how it would pan out moving into the next season, given that your family has actually come out and rescued one of the tournaments. How do you see it pan out?","Well, financial crises are global, and certainly hit the tennis world as well. But this is not that I've been -- this is not the topic that I've been thinking about that much, because my job is to win the matches on the court. With the winning, all the side things come, you know. So I don't think it's going to affect that much to the tennis world in the upcoming year. Certainly the financial situation is something that you're worried about always individually. You want to take care of your money. You want to place it in a safe spot. So the world has gone a bit crazy with the crisis in last couple of months, but I'm sure it's going to stabilize very soon.",Yes,Yes, 
176,1851,6679,Do you pay attention to how he plays?,"It would be nice, you know. I would have watched his match against Tipsarevic last week, but he's a bit of a better player than me at the moment. He obviously knows how to deal with these guys on a regular basis and it's still new for me.","You said ""at the moment,"" so you're ambitious to try and be as good as him?","Of course. Why not? He's a top player. That's what everyone wants to do. As I said last week, there is a lot of people fighting to do the same thing. It's not just me. Each week is a different challenge. Again, next week is another big challenge for me.",You're thinking that's what you want to do. That's where you've got to start?,"Of course. You need to be ambitious, and I am.","What's your goal, looking past Wimbledon and maybe at the end of the season? Have you got any targets? Maybe top 100, top 50?","I think top 100 is my goal, which it was at the beginning of the year, as well. I didn't get off to the best start of the year. But again, if you look back on my results, I played a lot of good players, especially in Australia, and it's been a tough year. But I kept the belief, and now it's starting to pay off a little bit. No reason why I can't finish the year in top 100.",What has Diego said to you?,Nothing really. I just had a shower and came in here to speak to you. I'll speak to him after this.,Yes,Yes, 
79,636,2354,"When you return home, do you go to sort of a domestic mindset and work around the house? Could you talk about what your life is like when you're not in the midst of a huge tournament back at home.","I mean, I have to say, the situation that we were in here at Wimbledon was very similar to the way we are at home. Obviously we have our family around. So we probably spend a little bit more time, you know, going to visit family and everything. Obviously taking care of the dogs and all that stuff. That's something that I love, as well. So, yeah, that's probably what we'll do. Then we have the event, the Best of Belgium event. Then we'll go to the States and spend some time with the American family side.","How competitive will the Best of Belgium match be? It's an exhibition. Exhibitions very often are played for fun, so everybody has a good time. It implies there's kind of a serious confrontation.","I think we also want to show our best. I think we're obligated in a way to show the people, you know, our best tennis. I think, you know, it's not a matter of who wins or loses there; it's a celebration of not just Justine and myself, but I think the past of Belgium sports and musicians and everything. I really look forward to it just because I think we've broken the record with all the attendance that we have. So it's going to be an amazing night.",Do you go out playing as if it's a fourth round of Wimbledon?,"I don't know. To be honest, I haven't really thought about that yet.", , , , ,UNK,UNK, 
264,11896,43372,You say you learnt a lot in the last year. Anything specific or in particular that you've discovered about yourself?,"Every single day you discover something new. Every time that you just wake up, it's gonna be something new. But, no, in my tennis life, tennis career, it was many things. You know, even to play semifinal in US Open. That match with Andy Murray, even it doesn't go well, there was something what I could learn a lot from that. You know, then through whole year, playing the Davis Cup, those matches, playing in Argentina, it's not something you're going to get on regular tournament. Then the final. There was many, many things that's been new for me. It's always good to have as much as possible of the experience. Yeah, I learn some of them.",Is that Davis Cup final still in your head? Do you still think about it a lot?,"No, it's not. I mean, it's nice actually talk about it now, talk about it on the dinner, during the day. But once you coming for the court, even for the practice, it has to be over, you know, because the season started, new season start, and nobody actually care about that. It's done. We won that, and that's it. So now everything starts from the beginning again, and that's how it is.",Did you see the match last night between Federer and Tomic?,"Actually not much. I didn't see much. I just seen couple of points actually today from the tiebreak in the second set. I mean, no, it's tough to say something about it if you see like three, four points. It's tough. I would be cooking from nothing. Sorry.", , , , ,No,No,watched a little
237,19427,70512,"The way the Brits are going out today, it's shaping up to be a pretty dark day for British tennis at Wimbledon. Do you feel sort of a collective responsibility, or are you solely focused on your own results?","You know, I can't speak for the other girls. I can only focus on my own tennis. You know, that's hard enough as it is. You know, the other girls, I'm sure, have tried their hardest. You can't guarantee the results at the end of the day, but I think you can definitely guarantee that all the British girls have tried, you know, 110%.","A lot of fans will look at the world of tennis and say, Hey, pretty glamorous; chance to travel the world; play Wimbledon; pretty good money. Is it a lot harder than people realize?","I think so, yeah. As women, to be doing what we're doing, you have to be pretty tough women, ambitious and determined. You know, that's me as a person. You know, you do it because you want to do it and you feel you can improve, you know, get further up the rankings. But there is a lot of hard work behind the scenes. You know, to put yourself through it, being away from home over 30 weeks of the year, you know, sacrificing, whether it's your social life or family time, you know, there's a lot you give up to do what you do. But, uhm, you do it for the love of the game, I guess.",In the end it's worth it?,I hope so. I'm figuring it out (laughter)., , , , ,UNK,UNK, 
120,2104,7526,The Sloane Stephens thing died down pretty quickly. Did she call you after your comments? What happened?,"No, she didn't call me after.","About the match, how do you rate your performance? You lost four games. You're a perfectionist, so how do you rate it?","I think it was okay. I haven't had a chance to talk about it after with my team, but I will. Like you said, I am a perfectionist. I always try to look for things that I know I can do better. When we get together I will see what I can do better.",You said the other day that you played really well on clay leading up to the French Open last year. You're still unbeaten so far on clay this season. Is there anything you took out of that experience you learned going into the French Open?,Definitely just not become overconfident. I think more than anything that's what I learned most. So I think I'll just take that with me to the French this year. I think I was a little confident last year and I felt really good; this year I'm going to take every moment like it's my last.,Last up you were saying about taking pace off. Is that hard to do naturally?,"It's easy actually, because, you know, when you take pace off you don't hit it as hard and you don't exhaust as much energy. So especially on the serve I think it's a little easier. Also, it's really fun just as well to hit a big serve and a big winner, too. Both of them can be fun.",Recently you declared you thought only of winning your matches. Now you enjoy it much more. What has changed from that time?,I thought only of what?,Yes,Yes, 
196,5074,18675,Did you say earlier that Boris has sleepless nights before your games?,"We don't sleep together, so I heard that from him once, but I can't say how many sleepless nights. You have to ask his wife (laughter).",Is it good to have a coach that gets that nervous?,"He doesn't show that. He doesn't show that. He's extremely tough mentally, always was. As a player, now as a coach. We only talk about that after the match is over or tournament is over. We talk about it a little bit. He never says that. He never shows his weakness. I think that's one of the characteristics and virtues that has helped him to be a champion.","Serena Williams yesterday said, looking forward to the final, she doesn't need to win another Wimbledon, that primarily she wants to have fun. Does that apply to you?","I'm sure she tries to also find that, I'd say, new source of inspiration and motivation, why she's there, why she's on the court. Also she's 32, 33 years old. She's one of the best tennis players ever to play the game, both women's and men's. She's incredible whatever she does. I probably think she's trying to relieve some of the pressure that she has. Everybody talks about the Serena Slam. Everybody talks about the Golden Slam, will she make it? She has another match, US Open as well. She's so dominant and superior on the court, it's really a pleasure to watch that. I'm sure she has fun, but she also wants to win it. That's for sure.","What's more important, fun or winning?",I would say both. Winning while having fun (smiling).,That's not good enough. Stop trying to fudge it.,"Well, what do you think the reaction of the people would be on Sunday if I step out and say, It's not about winning or losing, I just want to have fun. Roger or Andy, if you want to play, just for good laughs. I do have fun. I do enjoy playing tennis. Of course, I have to. But in order to get myself going, that's the point. But when you're on the court and fighting for the trophy like this, you want to win, trust me.",UNK,UNK, 
245,4906,18077, , , , ,What was the difference today in terms of what allowed Andy to beat you? Do you see yourself and Andy as being maybe the next biggest rivalry in tennis?,"I think we already have a rivalry. It's not the next. It's already existing there for many years. Andy is deservedly a winner today on the court. I thought what made the difference was his serve and my serve. I didn't serve well the first set and a half. After, I just wasn't able to serve. But not taking anything away from him, from his victory. He deserved it. He stepped in, played some great shots. Most of all the moments when he needed to, he served very, very well. Breakpoints that one game, when I had I think four, five opportunities to break back, he just came up always with big serves, so I couldn't do much. But it was a great week all in all for me. I didn't know what to expect obviously coming in, first hard court tournament. I know people always expect me to do well, but I try to be modest with my expectations and just kind of see how each day goes. When I reflect on the week, of course it's positive. I'm playing better as the tournament progressed, and hopefully I can continue in the same style in Cincinnati.",You seemed to have a little problem with your right elbow. You mentioned it yesterday.,"Yes, it was unfortunate. Came at the wrong time. But I guess because of the overload in a way, it's understandable. We played over two and a half hours to that point. So the elbow suffered a little bit. It was unfortunate because I didn't get any free points basically in the third set on my serve. That made a difference. It made my life difficult on the court.","Can you talk about the conditions out there, the heat, how that affected the play today.","Yeah, I actually didn't notice the thermal meter during the week except today. This is the first day. I don't know if they put it on purpose there. It showed maximum 50 Celsius on the court. So it was pretty warm. But, again, conditions are the same for both him and me. This is part of our sport. It's what we have to face. It's what we have to accept. Towards the end of the match it was a bit cooler. It was nicer to play. But overall very demanding physically, as it always is against Andy.",No,No, 
168,15687,56912,Today was not that day.,"Didn't work today. Yeah. I think, you know, the information that you can get is useful. It's also, you know, nice to have someone try to calm you down and things like that. You know, maybe next week it will work in my favor.",How much can you take in in that 30 seconds? What do you try to take in in that 30 seconds?,"I mean, I personally think Lindsay does a pretty good job of giving me three or four things that I think she thinks and Jon thinks that, you know, is not working or she's doing well. So, you know, just really trying to take a couple of bits of information and go out and try to do it in the next few games.","Looking forward to the rest of the season, the U.S. is going to play Fed Cup in Italy. Can you tell us how you see the match for the U.S.?","Honestly I have not even given it a second of thought. I mean, Italy is always good. We have lost to Italy a lot, like every year. (Smiling.) I mean, it will be a tough match. It always is. I think every Fed Cup tie is tough. There is always really good players playing for their country. Hopefully we beat Italy this time.","In that third set it looked like the backhand wasn't cranking, especially down the line. When you see that happening, you just kept doing it?","Yeah, I'm that person, Oh, I didn't make it? Let me try it again 37 times.",Even though Lindsay told you not to do it?,Yeah. (Smiling).,UNK,Yes, 
6,5649,20691,Andy was saying the same thing yesterday. Have you two been having a chat? What do you want to see done? He wants the balls standardized.,"For me is not necessary a standard ball. But during a season when you have straight tournaments, for example, you start the clay court season, you have the same ball for the clay court season; you have the American hard court season, have the same ball. Indian Wells and Miami, that happens, there is the same ball in both tournaments, so that's positive. But here, for example, you play in Bangkok one ball, Tokyo another ball, here another ball. That's something that can change. Is not put a standard ball for all the year. We can have different balls on tour. But you cannot change the ball every week. That's too much, in my opinion. Is dangerous for the injuries.","Same was the case on the clay, wasn't it? They changed going into Roland Garros, Madrid and Rome changed to get in line with Roland Garros.","For me, I understand. That is not very important change because you have one week to prepare Roland Garros. That's the true. In the previous tournaments before Roland Garros, I think was Nice and World Cup in Dusseldorf was the same ball, so that's positive. But what cannot happen is have one ball in Rome, one ball in Madrid, one ball in Barcelona. That don't work, doesn't work, because are straight weeks. You have a week to adapt to the ball, in my opinion is not a problem. But the problem is, for example, when you arrive to the final, for example let's say the ball is different between Madrid and Rome, you arrive to the final in Madrid, in one day you have to play with completely different ball in Rome.","You know why it is, though? Because of the commercial deals that each tournament can make for itself. So do you think this is a problem that is an indication of everything that you're talking about?",I am very happy to win less money and be more health.,"As we just heard, Andy has similar feelings about this as you've just been explaining. What about the other players? Is there a strong feeling?","I talked with Gilles Simon this afternoon and he believe exactly the same. Yeah, a lot of players believe that. We don't need to make a big history of that. Just try to change and that's it.","Can I ask you about something in your book. When you talked about Novak Djokovic, you said three or four years ago when you were asked: There's you and there's Federer, who will be the next player who might challenge you? You said straightaway Djokovic. What was it that you saw in Djokovic then that made you think he would be the player to challenge you and Roger?","Well, later was Andy Murray. I say that four years ago because is when Djokovic started to play really well. And for me, the level what he shows to everybody in Australia 2007, was really, really high. So I thought that in 2007 he will be the No.1. No, 2008 I thought that. But after that I think I had a fantastic season. But, you know, he is able to do very difficult things very easy, so... He can play inside the court. The most difficult thing on tennis is play inside the court and change the direction of the ball. He was able to do it really well and very easy.",Yes,UNK, 
239,18311,66506,"Well, let's go tonight.","Tonight he was great.  There's no doubt about it.  Tonight he was, you know -- I took his best stuff for five sets and I thought I was going to get him to break or to fold.  I thought if I kept it on him long enough that that would happen. Tonight he played like a great, great player.  There's no doubt about that.  And tonight his backhand was extremely impressive.","Is the disappointment more in the loss, or that you had kind of an up-and-comer just zone on you for that long?","I think we're the same age, but he's an up-and-comer (laughter). It's tough because, you know, I think there's definite disappointment in the loss.  And I guess if you're given a choice to play well in a loss or play, like, terrible in a loss, you want to choose to play well. But, you know, that makes it pretty disheartening also.  Being pissed off is a lot easier than being disappointed.","Now that you're out, any thoughts about the court?  The speed slower than the past?  Not quite as advantageous to your game?","You know, it's a court.  I don't know if it's so much the court.  I think, you know, the way the balls react to it.  When you play with new balls it's like a different surface.  Then all of a sudden seven, eight games later, it's just a lot different. You know, but I guess that's the process that it takes to kind of get the surface you want.  I don't know if you're going to get it perfect the first time out.  But it is what it is, man.  I don't mind the surface.  I don't mind the effect that it has.  It's just different.", , , , ,Yes,No, 
73,6877,25134,"You look like a different player compared to two years ago, one year ago, in the way you play. You have or chances, more things to do, you don't play the same in the court. What happened? What is the reason?","Well, the reason is that I'm working hard, working hard with my coaches, trying to improve my game, and that's it. It doesn't happen just in one day, so it needs some time. When I was playing, you know, and my game was something different and I was doing it for many years, it's not going to change in a few days. So I'm happy that it works, that it's changed. That's the way how to keep the position, how to keep with the top guys. So far I'm, I would say, successful. But still there is a place for improvement, but that's what I need to work on.",And you go more on the ranking?,"Yeah, that's part of it, as well. So, yeah, I mean, it's quite many things from the past, and that's it. If you gonna stay on the same line, you're going to stay on the same line in the rankings. You have to change, you have to improve, you have to do something new, better, and that's it. Everybody does the same.",Did you feel that Novak got himself more focused in the second and third sets? What was the difference in his level of play?,"Well, I don't know what was difference. I think it was just small pieces of difference. I don't know how to say it. But in the beginning of the second set, I had like five breakpoints. He had one. He made it, it was 3Love. It could easily be 21 with a break for me, and it was completely other way. So it's tough to say what was different. I think he was playing pretty much the same. But, as I said, the wind doesn't help at all to my game. But it's the same for both of us. I have to deal with that. That's how it is. First set, beginning of the second set, I had a feeling I was even better from the rallies, which is not every time with him. I was beating him from the rallies. But, you know, it just change a bit with the conditions. I didn't keep with that. Him, yes. So that was probably the difference.",Could you be more precise in the way you are disadvantaged because of the conditions.,No.,Why was it a disadvantage for you and not for Novak?,Actually I didn't say it's a disadvantage.,UNK,UNK, 
84,13308,48492,Do you feel like this puts you very up against it in terms of trying to make the last four?,"Obviously, yeah. I mean, it's harder to qualify when you lose your first match. That's pretty obvious. But, yeah, unlike the other events, you still have a chance to go through. If this were anywhere else, I would be out of the tournament. Yeah, you need to try to forget about today, work on some things tomorrow, and hopefully play better on Tuesday.","On a side note, you've spoken about why wearing the poppy is important to you. Talk a little bit about how you learned about what it means and whether you've been asked about it from players from other countries?","Yeah, I've been asked about it by players. Before I actually even got asked  when I was wearing a poppy in Paris a couple of years ago, I got asked by quite a lot of the press exactly what it was for. But, yeah, I would have been curious. When I was young, my grandparents used to wear poppies. Yeah, I would have asked them about it when I was young. My parents would have explained to me when I was a kid.","Given the nature of the way you got to the Finals in the first place, is there enough in the tank to do things the hard way again this week?","Well, I felt okay on the court today. I don't think that was the reason why I lost the match. I guess if I was to play a threehour match which was extremely physical, then maybe I would feel fatigued in the latter stages of a match like that. But, yeah, obviously now I need to win my next two matches more than likely, and win them well if I want to go through. That's going to be tricky because Milos obviously played fantastic last week in Paris, and Roger always plays well at this event. So I'm definitely going to have to play better if I want to get through.",I saw a comment from you saying you still need to find an extra 4% or 5% to get back to your top level. Has it surprised you how long the process has taken and how frustrating has that been?,"No. I mean, the beginning of the year was hard because I didn't feel like I was playing particularly well at the beginning of the year. I feel like I've played well for most of the events since the French Open really. I've had fairly consistent, decent results. But, yeah, to beat the top players consistently, you need to be playing at your top level all the time or close to it. Yeah, at the beginning of the year it was hard, because before I had my surgery, I was consistently there. When you come back and you aren't quite there, that's obviously frustrating. Over time you get used to that, and mentally you start to understand why that might happen. Yeah, you deal with it. So, no, I think it's been a fairly normal process. It's not been anything out of the ordinary, but something that I've had to learn a lot this year about what that's like. Yeah, I'm sure I'll be good next year.","How does the court, the speed and the bounce, play compared to some of the other courts you've been on indoors the last few weeks? How would you describe it?","It's quite lively, to be honest. It can be hard to control the ball that can bounce pretty high up on the serve, on the kick serve. Yeah, it's quicker than the other courts. It's definitely quicker than Valencia and Paris, I would say that. I don't know exactly why that is, because the balls are the same and it's the same court, I believe, manufacturer. I don't know if it's to do with just how big the stadium is, and it does get warm in there. I'm not sure. But, yeah, it's quite lively.", UNK,UNK, 
56,901,3314,"Sports psychology has been quite trendy this summer. What do you do to get yourself mentally right, and have you changed your approach to that?","I think it's one of the key things for my tennis, personally. When I'm mentally right, I play well. But I don't feel I need to see a psychologist or anything like that. I just learn a lot from the people around me, like my coach and parents and the people closest to me.",What was the tip then? You've not yet beaten a top10 player. How were you told to overcome that hurdle? May be a mental as well as physical barrier.,I didn't want to play her today as who she was. I wanted to play her as just the person that's I wanted to play the tournament. I didn't care who it was. Just wanted to get on the next round.,"Comments about coaches letting players slip and slide and that sort of thing, do you not think will we not see much of an advancement in British tennis unless the attitude changes?","I guess it just depends who you are. I don't know who the next people coming up are after the junior players now. You know, I say we could suddenly have lots of good players or we could have not so many.","Will you be wearing your lucky dress again, or is it now unlucky?",I think for doubles I'm going to wear the skirt and top like I did for mixed doubles., , ,UNK,UNK, 
25,1073,3905,"On a serious note, does that sometimes feel good to vent, let it all out?","It feels good at the moment. But then when you actually do it, you realize where you have done it - on the Centre Court of Wimbledon - and then you question yourself: Was it the really good thing to do? I'm emotional, so sometimes I do show my good emotions, bad emotions. Try to control it as much as I can, but it's part of me. I can't change myself.","We don't know who your opponent will be next of course. If you could, take each one separately and discuss the potential matchups starting perhaps with Rafa.","If I get to play Rafa it will be another important match that I play him, you know. This year we have played so many finals and important matches. Obviously even though it's a different surface, you know, I believe I can win against him. He's been on a winning streak in Wimbledon for last, you know, I don't know, almost 20 matches. He's playing great on grass. He has still a lot of confidence and he knows how it feels like to win a trophy at Wimbledon. Me, I don't know, because I never been there. But, look, you know, I have really nothing to lose. I will step on the court and be aggressive, you know, try to take it to him, because I don't want him to feel the control of the match. If I get to play Andy, obviously he's a home favorite. He wants to be in the finals as much as I want it. I am sure that he, above all, wants to get his first Grand Slam title. This would be the perfect place. I mean, he's been playing great. In last two, three months he, I think, started playing much better than he did in the opening three, four months of the year. We have quite similar styles of the game. So I guess against both of those guys will be an even match.","The finals in Australia would have hurt him, wouldn't it? I think he's admitted how much that hurt him.","Well, that's for him to answer really. But, look, he played in couple finals of a Grand Slam, three finals. But, you know, he came back. You have to give him credit for that. It's not easy. Everybody knows that he can win a Grand Slam, but he didn't. But now he's coming back and he's playing really well on grass under all this pressure that he has here. I'm sure he has a lot of motivation, so...",Is it true that the first Grand Slam is the hardest one to win?,"Probably, yes.",But you and Andy are of a similar age. Have you grown in stature as a player since you won your first Grand Slam?,"Yes. I mean, we have developed into professional tennis players of very similar age. We have grown up together playing juniors circuit. Actually, first time we played we were 11 years old, 12 years old, in France. It's very long time ago, you know. But it's great to see somebody, you know, in your generation doing so well. I mean, we played so many matches throughout last 10 years. But, you know, I know he will make it because he has a great game.",UNK,UNK, 
97,4711,17334,What did you think at the time when that happened?,That I was extremely lucky. I liked it a lot (smiling).,What is the feeling for you at your age to be into the second week of Wimbledon and be the oldest man still in the competition?,"It's a great feeling, you know. I really like what I do. I'm just having fun. So if I'm able to do this at my age, it is unbelievable still. And I don't know for how much longer I can do this, but right now I don't have an issue with injuries a lot. And I am healthy, motivated. So I will go on.",It's a fair chance you play Murray in the next round on Centre Court. Will it worry you to go out and basically upset a whole nation by beating a Brit?,"Yeah, that could be not nice, I guess, but that's what I try to do. Yeah.",How do you explain your longevity in the game? Is it partly your style of play that you're able to save some energy because there aren't a lot of long rallies? Or is there something else behind it?,"I think it's because I begin late. I begin a lot later than everybody else in this professional ATP, you know. Because I, when I was young, I didn't have a lot of opportunities to develop earlier, so I begin later. That's why I don't feel that I'm used up, like, still.",What do you think about the fifthset tiebreaker? Do you think it's a good idea?,It is good idea if you...,Yes,Yes, 
147,5891,21697,Why did you decide to have a little training right now after the match?,"Yeah.  I was focusing the tactics, practicing the tactic of tomorrow.",Was it spontaneous?,"No.  48 percent inside serves.  I just trying to have some serves inside.  That's it.  I just having twenty minutes of serves, no practice.",Do you consider yourself as the favorite tomorrow?  You have one like 66 matches in a row.,"He's the No.1.  Always he's the favorite.  Clay I have a lot of wins, 66 wins consecutive.  But he's arriving playing very well, and I will beat him sometimes on clay, but the last two times he beat me in:  Wimbledon and Masters Cup in Shanghai. And, well, I am not the favorite I think, no.  I think he's No.1 and he start very good the season, too.  He won in Australia, Dubai, and now he's in the final.  Going to be tough match.",You have a same opinion of Federer about ATP problems and the calendar of 2009.  Do you think that Federer has the same opinion of yours about which is the No.1 on clay?,"I don't know.  You can ask him.  You can ask him.  But for sure -- I don't know.  It's very difficult thing about this tournament in 2009.  2009 not got going to be a Masters Series, no?  Because it's one of my favorite tournaments, and in my opinion, one of the favorite of everybody, no? It's very, very nice place.  Very nice atmosphere every day.  The court was full almost every day.  Unbelievable.  Very, very nice tournament, and I hope that's going to change.  But I think it's going to be difficult, no?","You are Spanish, but we have never asked you -- I have never asked you -- about Madrid as a Masters Series.  What do you think about that?  Because that's the tournament that makes all the problems because Madrid comes in the spring, Hamburg, Barcelona, Monte-Carlo.  What do you think?","Well, I don't have too much opinion about that because I love the tournament of Madrid, but right now my opinion is perfect.  Indoor is very, very nice tournament for my opinion.  It's the nicest indoor of the Tour for sure. So I don't know if that much going to be the same outside than in indoor.  It's very nice tournament.  I love this tournament. But the thing is, well, I don't want this tournament go out of Masters Series, no?  But I don't know Madrid, I want to finish the Tour.  But, no, I think we don't want this tournament and Hamburg go out.",No,No,

We will reassess that in the evening.",Did your opponent say anything to you during the timeout period? Was she getting frustrated?,I didn't see it. I think you had a better view on that than me.,"She didn't want to initially come to her chair. She looked a little curious why on breakpoint the medical timeout occurred. Did she say anything to you or did you say, Sorry, I have to take the timeout?","No. I have a huge respect for her. We played a tight match before. You know, I feel lucky that I got away with it, with serving 60 miles an hour serves. I think it was very visible that, you know, I just couldn't do differently. I was trying to get help. As I said before, I tried it for a few points already. I called the trainer before. So that's how it ended up being.",Did you think about waiting just the one point? There was a changeover one point away.,"The previous points as well. I had a game point several times. I did wait a few points, yeah.",UNK,No, 
86,16768,60833,At what point did you not want to throw up on court?,"(Laughter.) When I was in the tunnel I was like, Well, you better get it together now before everybody else sees your breakfast.","Easier said than done. So when you start striking the ball, do the nerves naturally go...","Yeah, of course. In muscle memory when you're out there on the court you're going to do what's natural and what you've been taught. So that kind of went away, and as soon as that went away I started feeling much better.","Very much a hard game with obviously movement and retrieving defense, and she said that she didn't feel  you know, she couldn't move today for some reason. Did you sense that maybe she wasn't at the top of her game?","I can't really speak for her. I don't really know. I know she's a good counterpuncher and runs a lot of balls down. I tried to, like I said be forward in the court and try to look to take advantage of short balls if I got them. Like I said, it worked out.",She says you did that very well. You took advantage of all your opportunities and everything.,Yeah.,Did you feel like you like played above your level today? Were you in the zone or you played within yourself today?,"No, I definitely played within myself. I don't really know what else to say. I played within myself and that's why I won.",UNK,UNK, 
137,447,1619,"Is it doubly frustrating to lose to the same person three times so far this year, or is it a loss is a loss and it's frustrating anyway?","Um, it's not frustrating. It's just disappointing, you know. Yeah, there is a different -- frustrating can be quite negative and quite, you know, pulling yourself down. But, no, it's happened before. You know, I remember losing to Murray in a short period of time on a few occasions. It happened against Nadal. That's what I always said. If you get off a good start and start beating one guy, then you play him the same -- you're playing the same guy on few occasions in a short period of time, you can get quite a few wins, you know. I did that at the end of last year against him. He did it now at the beginning of the year against me. That's how it goes, you know. I don't know if I'd rather lose against three multiple different guys, you know, ranked outside of the top 50. I guess not. I'd rather lose against a guy that's ranked very high so I know I'm controlling the rest of the field against top guys. If I'm playing well, I know I can beat them, too. So that's what it is. At the end of the day I can't change it, and I'm happy with my game.",You said in the doubles they played an unconventional game. Can you explain it a little bit? What made them difficult to beat? Because they only played just one week together.,"I guess it's part of that. They don't quite know themselves yet what's the best way to play. They decide to come in sometimes; they stay back. It's not classic doubles, even though Xavier can play that well very easily; Alexandr, honestly I've never seen him play doubles before, so it's hard for me to know exactly, you know, what he normally likes to do in the doubles. But, you know, just the way, you know, especially Dolgopolov returns, just goes for broke kind of thing. It's tricky, and it seemed to work. Maybe conditions helped them tonight. It was a bit slower, you couldn't use the kick serve, and the bounce as much. But at the end of the day they won the superbreaker, which is not purely luck. They were good and tough all the way through, you know. We had our chances, but what I liked about them is they had a good attitude, you know, maybe very relaxed. I'm also very relaxed in doubles, but still feel I need a bit more intensity to do well, which was a fun doubles to be part of. I really enjoyed it.","Can I switch topics a bit? The Wayne Odesnik situation, the guy who was suspended for a year.",It's a great subject. I love talking about that right now.,"But he's been playing a couple months futures, and I'm sure you're aware of that.",I didn't know that.,He talked to the ITF and got the suspension reduced by one year. What do you think the reception is going to be for the guy when he comes back on the tour?,I don't know. I don't know the guy. I didn't know he was playing again. Ask someone else. Not me.,Yes,Yes, 
184,9279,33854,"Leading 5-1, it seems you hit a wall. What happened there?","Yeah, until 5-1 I was doing quite well. I was feeling good and I was hitting the ball well. But then all of a sudden I just got exhausted, completely lost my concentration. It was hard for me throughout, you know, for that rest of the match to keep up because the points were quite long. The longer the play went, I felt worse and worse. I just couldn't do it. I'm still not in the best physical shape. I'm suffering in that department. It will take time for me to get that better because at the moment, you know, I'm struggling to play in a high level for two sets. If I was playing three sets, I don't know, they would probably take me in an ambulance and I would go out (laughter). But that's the way it goes.",Did you feel ill?,"I felt dizzy on the court. I needed a little bit of time after the match to come, you know, to life again. You know, I felt not so good. I'm still not feeling that strong. I'm feeling weak at the moment. But what can I do?",Is it harder to accept because the first ranking was available for you this week?,"It's okay. Doesn't matter the first ranking. I want to be healthy. I want to improve. I want to play tennis. I mean, I don't really think about No.1 or whatever happens. If it's going to happen, it will happen. But at the moment I don't deserve that spot. I am not in the best shape. I am not, you know, at my highest level. So it will take time for me to get better and better.",Was the knee okay today?,"My knee was okay. But because of the knee, I wasn't able to play for more than two weeks after Wimbledon and I completely got out of shape. You know, I lost also my muscles, endurance of course. It cannot happen overnight. You need days of training and days of hard work to get it better.","You knew it was going to be against Cibulkova, but did you think it was going to be that tough?","I knew it was going to be a tough match because I played against her at the French Open. But there I was in good shape. I could play the long points. And she was the one who got tired. I was the one who was physically better at the French Open, and so I won in two sets. Especially on clay, where she plays better, the points are even longer, and she has a better chance. And here I should have a, you know, better chance, kind of an upper hand, you know, on this surface, on a hard court. But when you're not prepared well enough, it's hard. She returns a lot of balls. She runs very well. It's tough to take a point against her. You have to earn it and you have to work hard for everything when you're playing against her.",No,No, 
5,14619,53049,"Can you talk about your box, the red, blue, white.  Was that your idea?","No, they actually wanted to surprise me, and they did.  They did.  It's fantastic.  You know, we had this thing going on, similar situation, in French Open for the semifinals.  They were dressed all in yellow shirts, like 15 or 20 people, because I was wearing that yellow shirt in French Open. Right now they wanted to make it look even better, you know, the colors of our flag, of Serbia.  So it was very nice.",Whose idea was it?,"Probably my parents' idea.  Not DeNiro's idea, that's for sure.","You've had an extraordinary year.  In your heart, do you think you're ready to win a Slam, a major?","I think I'm ready, and I need to be ready.  I need to think like this.  I need to believe in myself, because otherwise I wouldn't get the positive outcome.  I don't want to go out tomorrow and try to do my best or try to perform well.  No, I'll go tomorrow to try to win.","All of your runs deep into these tournaments, will that help you?","Yeah, yeah.  If I play Roger, you know, I'm gonna try to believe in the victory.  The win over him in Montral will help me, that's for sure.","Are you concerned you've been out on the court 16 hours, that you'll be less than your physical best tomorrow in your first Slam final?","Well, I don't want to be concerned.  As I was saying, I want to be positive, just try to do all the things what I need to do to recover, get ready hundred percent for tomorrow's match.",Yes,Yes, 
124,4205,15404, , ,Pretty tough to stop a legend while he's playing like that?,"Yeah, he played great today. You know, I didn't really have any chance in the first set, but I had an opportunity in the second set to go up a break, and a few opportunities. And one of them, he actually missed a backhand, which should have been my game, I think for me. It would have been -- not necessarily would have won the match or anything, but it would have given me a bit of confidence. I wasn't really ahead in any of the sets. That made it tough, but, no, he played great today, and missed very few balls. Didn't give me too many chances.","What's your overriding feeling after the match? Obviously disappointment, but do you have some pride having got that far?","I'm disappointed right now, you know. I wish I could have done a few things better, and given myself a few more opportunities, but, you know, I'm sure tomorrow after a few days, whenever it sort of sinks in -- it's obviously been a very good couple of weeks. And I'll try my best to work on my game, work harder, and hopefully come back and do better next time.","Do you feel the deck was stacked against you? You had that match with Nadal, obviously the No.1 seed Sunday. Now, no real rest while Federer was very much rested for this match?","Yeah, like I said yesterday, you know, ideally I would have preferred to be in his position, but I don't think that was really the reason, you know, why he won the match. You know, if he played like that, I was absolutely fresh, I'm sure it still would have been a very tough one for me to win. But ideally, yeah, I would have liked to have a day off.",You were flexing the knee at certain points. Was that an issue?,"No, I have problems with my knee sometimes in matches, and it wasn't anything that had any bearing on the outcome of the match.",UNK,No, 
234,17161,62106,"That upsets you, I think.","Yeah. Yeah, it does.","Do you have trouble with the wind, particularly here you're on an island?","Little bit. But, you know, the other guy deals with it, too. It's always windy here. It's just something you got to deal with.",Do you feel you could have an intimidating factor when you're playing like a Rochus or one of these little guys who are foot and a half shorter than you?,"You know, if I played the right way. If I impose myself and serve big and take some chances on the serve and come at him and kind of get in his face, you know, tennis-speaking, I think can you kind of impose yourself and make a statement.","What do you have to do to get to the next level, Sam? Obviously John had the big breakthrough a few years ago. He said he lost his confidence last year. You've had your spots, too. What has to be done?","You know, I've been working harder lately than I've ever been working. Not necessarily harder, but more focused. The stuff I'm -- training I'm doing I think is better than I was doing. I'm at the track, the gym. I've been working on the right things. A lot on my backhand and my return. That's the main focus on all my practices this year. This year already -- in the previous two years I feel like I would have a good tournament, and then a bad one. Good tournament. This year already, it's a little more kind of, I mean, level, I guess you would say. You know, how my -- like results-wise. I mean, the finals, a couple quarterfinals, third round last week. So already it's an improvement. I think if I just keep working hard and doing what I'm doing -- I'm confident right now. I'm playing really well. There's not too many guys -- when I walk on the court, there aren't too many guys I think will beat me. Hopefully I will keep this mindset and keep working hard. My goal is to be in the top 20 at the end of the year.","When you get your racquets from the company, how much adjustment do you have done to it?",Not much at all. I used to play with them. They would just take them off the shelf and send them to me. A year ago I started kind of making it so they're all the same. I think it's just very little adjustments.,Yes,Yes,UNK?
194,1942,7002,Back to the French Open/Wimbledon double. What are the challenges? It's been quite a while since someone on the women's side has accomplished that feat.,"A Grand Slam stage, when you're playing for two weeks, seven matches within those two weeks, you're always kind of rolling with each round. You're going to the next one. Once you get to another one, one of the toughest things is you start from scratch, you start from the first match. Mentally that's always, you know, a bit more difficult because you achieve some great success, then you get on the train, come here, and right away the mentality switches that I've got to start from the first round on. You don't get any free points or any byes. That's always a quick switch that you need to make mentally. Physically you know the physical aspects of the surface, they're much tougher than they were many years ago. That transition has always been quite tough for me. Every year I try to maybe find a better formula towards my body and what will get me enough rest and enough practice and matches and all that.",Have you changed anything up this year?,"No. Actually I usually played maybe an XO match. But this year it was just too much. It was such a quick turnaround, I didn't really have time. I actually came in and played a couple practice matches with some girls. Other than that, not really.","The shop, has it gone as well as you hoped? Am I right in thinking it's kind of a popup thing?",It is.,It's going to vanish?,I don't like the word 'vanish.' Sounds like something from Harry Potter. I love Harry Potter. It's definitely a popup shop. It's running through Wimbledon. Maybe it will be back next year. Depends on the location that we can get.,Do you credit your top performance lately to being happy in your personal life?,"Yeah, I think it's always nice to have a great balance. What you do on the court and off the court, they're very different. But it's great to have the right balance because ultimately a career only lasts for so many years, especially for a woman. It's definitely nice to feel like you're mentally happy out there when you're on the court.",Yes,Yes, 
172,8248,30054,Take us through the break game in the fifth set. Pretty incredible. Two fighters. Not certain which way the match is going to go.,"Yeah, I played a lot better in the fifth than I did probably, you know, from the second on. I returned a lot better. Even had looks early in the set. He came up with some good serves. You know, but I kind of just went for my shots a little bit more. He hit one kind of bad forehand that let me get a look. You know, that was kind of it. At that point I don't know what separates it from one of the games where you're close and you don't break. You know, it's just a matter of points going the right way there.","Did he surprise you? Because he seemed to get injured midway through the second set, but he kept going.","Yeah, I noticed it in the fourth, the fourth set. But he actually had treatment for it I think the other day against Stepanek, as well, if I'm not mistaken. If anything, I mean, props to him, because he made the adjustment. He wasn't retrieving as much. He started kind of stepping into the middle of the court, you know, almost playing freer. He was kind of bullying the ball around a little bit more. You know, he certainly made a pretty smart adjustment there and gave me something else to deal with.",Is there a more mentally tough opponent out there than Lleyton Hewitt?,He's certainly up there.,"You've had many games with Andy. Where would you put his return of serve, given it's such a massive part of your game, the serving option?","Yeah, I mean, it's tough. You know, obviously when you get to the top returners, it's tough to pick much between them. But he's certainly in the conversation among the best returners.","If it should rain on Friday and the roof is required - I'm sure you don't want to think about this - but do you have any concerns about taking a few moments to get used to how the ball might behave, or the fact that Murray has had a chance to experience that?","Obviously, I'd kind of rather know what I was in for than have it be a surprise. But that's not really something I have too much control over. You know, you just deal with it the best you can.",No,No, 
15,18066,65592,It appears there are going to be three Russians in the finals here.,Semifinals.,Is there rhyme or reason to that? Why is it so many talented players are from Russia?,"It's a big country, what do you expect? How many millions? 140 million people living in that country. Sport is very big in my country. It's not only tennis; it's soccer, it's hockey, it's gymnastics. We are very dedicated to what we do. Even though last couple of years Russians were not really doing so well, if you look at the rankings before, maybe it was like five Russians in top 10. But now it's just a few. But still we're able to come up with a good tennis here and there. I mean, if you look at the draw, you know, pretty much everywhere one of the Russians is doing well.","Is it a huge emphasis as a kid in Russia, tennis?","When I started, it was very popular. We had a lot of tennis schools which were for free. It was a part of the sport program. So I believe, you know, people saw a good opportunity also to travel the world and also, you know, make a living out of their hobby.",Seemed like one of the tactics today was to attack Sam's backhand quite a bit to open up her forehand. Can you talk about that.,"Yeah, definitely Sam has a very dangerous forehand so you have to stay away from it. One of the tactics was to try to get her into her backhand side and then make her guess, you know, surprise her from time to time with shots to her forehand. Looked like at the end of the match she was kind of falling apart because she didn't really know if I'm going backhand or forehand. So she kind of start making more errors at the end.",Is it easier for you to play another Russian or easier to play a non-Russian?,"I'd say it's easier to play a non-Russian. There's a lot of rivalry, a lot of competition between Russians. We always want to be better and higher ranked amongst each other. Of course, there's a bit more pressure. But at the end of the day it's another opponent, someone you have to play on the other side of the net. With the years, you learn to block it away and try to focus on the things you have to do.",Yes,Yes, 
10,2527,9165,How satisfying was it to win in two sets today after your battle against Nalbandian in the previous round?,"Well, the match before is past right now, no? Yeah, doesn't matter if that match happened two days ago. I'm happy about the 6-2, 6-4 against big player like Del Potro. So that's the thing.",You look like you lowered your toss to further out in front and your serve looks a lot better. Have you improved it a lot?,"Yeah, that's what I don't want.",You don't want it?,"I want it to be more inside. That's why I was practicing a little bit more. No, in the beginning, yeah, I was putting the ball okay, but in the second set I start to put the ball lower and lower. Yeah, I think a little bit more higher is better for my serve, I think for everyone.","In tennis history, the sport seems to have been more popular when there have been great rivalries such as McEnroe and Brg, McEnroe and Connors, Sampras and Agassi. Do you feel that you're bringing the game back to that kind of level and does it excite you?","I didn't understand that. I understand everything, but you didn't finish the question.",I'm asking if you're excited by it and does it...,"Yeah. Well, I'm not one to say if I improve the game and if the game more popular right now because I am here. I don't think so. But anyway, if it's like this, I am not the right person to say.",Yes,UNK, 
157,1970,7081,First match since Wimbledon. Happy with the way everything went?,"Well, yeah. I mean, the goal was to try to get through as many matches as possible this week. Obviously, like you say, with the conditions the way they are, it was tricky. My opponent, you know, is very confident now. He had a good win yesterday, won the tournament the week before. I wanted to try to get through the match. Just managed to do that in the end.","Every player seems to complain about the balls year after year. Different ball used at the US Open, for example. Why don't the players do something about it? Can you do something about it?","Well, we try and do a lot of things about a lot of different things. It's not easy. But, yeah, I mean, from a player's perspective, changing balls from weektoweek is not good. If you ask a golfer to do that, to change their ball every week, they'd be hitting the ball everywhere. Marcel, for example, played on a different surface on Saturday. He's playing with different balls, a different court, different continent a couple days later. It's very, very difficult to adjust your game to that. From a player's point of view, it is difficult when you're changing every week.",Has anything changed for you since winning Wimbledon?,"I don't think so. I mean, the few days after were very, very busy. It was a bit different to what I'm used to after events. But once I got back to training and stuff, everything kind of went back to normal. Coming back to the tournaments and stuff, it feels the same.",Royal baby take some pressure off you?,"That was a huge story. Lot of pressure on that baby, that's for sure (smiling).","Now that you're heading into this part of the season as the defending US Open champion, has that changed your preparations at all, or are you treating it as you would any other year?","I think preparations stay pretty much the same. It's a new experience for me. I can say I will handle it well, but also I don't know. I've never been in that position before. I'll do all of the same sort of things I did last year to get ready, stay in the same hotel, try and get comfortable in the same sort of surroundings, hopefully perform well. But it's probably not an easy thing to do, I would imagine. I'll just have to wait and see how I deal with it.",No,No, 
37,3111,11310,Is it still fun for you to play tennis?,"It depends what match it is, depends under what circumstances. The whole thing, it's nothing new. When you are young, 20 years old, 19 years old, you're coming, everything is new. It's exciting come and play the big matches. With the years, you start to feel the pressure. A little bit you start to be unsure in certain moments of the match, hit it down the line or play a little bit cross-court. So you start to feel a little bit uncomfortable on the court, and this is what makes you have doubts. Eventually it comes to the errors. The young boys are not scared anymore. They will eventually be scared with the years, but it's tough to play against them in such conditions.",Twice you have a Davis Cup final and twice you won it. Are you going to play Davis Cup this season?,"Yeah, we're going to play. We're going to Romania. Looking forward. I think we have a great team. If everybody will be fit throughout the year, excited to play, we gonna give it a try. Why not? It will be great, I think.",You touched on being stressed on the tennis court. Would you be stressed after 5 hours and 34 minutes like Lpez and Muller were today?,"I don't want to be in the shoes of Lpez, be on the court five hours and lose 16-14 on the fifth set. It's not a really nice start of the season, let's put it this way. I don't want to be in his shoes, for sure.",Why do you think we see some unusual finalists at this tournament?,"Good questions. If I knew the answer I would give it to you. It looks like it happens at the beginning of the year only because on the rest of the season, normally it's the same Nadal and Federer finals. So maybe it keeps it a little more interesting this week.",What are you going to do after tennis? You don't have to tell us if you don't want to.,"Enjoy myself. Enjoy myself. Enjoy being out of tennis. See it in a different way. Watch tennis on TV, for example. Cheer for somebody else. I don't know.",No,Yes, 
16,12407,45163,What happened in the beginning? Because she seemed almost in control there for a while.,"Yeah, I think I was a little bit nervous. She was playing really well. I wasn't playing as smart as I wanted and started playing my shots. So, you know, after I kind of sat down and gave myself a talking to, I kind of got myself back in control.","Can you tell us what you said to yourself, or is that Xrated?","No, it was, you know, mostly just, you know, You have to play to win and she's not going to give it to you. So just go out and do your best and go for your shots.","Do you feel like you have been playing well in this tournament overall? You haven't had the toughest draw, haven't played anybody top 70 I think for the first several rounds. You have had not the easiest score lines sometimes. Are you happy with your role overall or happy to be getting through?","I think I'm playing pretty well. I feel everyone I have been playing has been playing well. I mean, they haven't been the highestranked players but they are also good players. So they have been tough matches, but at the same time, I felt like I should have won them, which is kind of a different experience for me. I'm pretty happy with how I have been doing so far.","Do you feel like you should win things? Do you feel like you belong in a quarterfinals of a slam? It's not like, Oh, look at me, I'm here, or is it more, Yeah, this is right.","I want to say that but I'm just happy I'm in the second quarter. No, I definitely feel like when I'm walking out onto the courts, not only do I feel people are expecting me to win but I am expecting me to win. That's a different pressure than I'm putting on myself. I think I have handled it pretty well so far.",What does it mean to you to see so much success right here for American players concurrent with your success? What do you think it might mean as a spring board for future success of American players?,"I think it's great. You know, I think, you know, it's great that Coco went out and won today, as well. Denis is in the round of 16 for the first time. It's been a while since there has been that many Americans in the second week, and, you know, it's just really exciting. I think it's going to kind of inspire everyone else to keep doing well and keep working hard.",Yes,Yes, 
212,7404,27047,When was that decision made? Was that a recent decision?,"Yeah. Well, he's not with me since Paris indoors, so it's only two weeks.",I imagine that was a hard decision or a hard conversation to have.,"Well, of course it's a tough decision. I won't say hard. I think tough. But, you know, at some point throughout my career I have been going through some tough decisions. That's what helped me to be where I am right now.","Are you planning to bring a different coach in, or are you going to continue to be like this for the time being?","We will see. I have been playing so many matches. I have been hitting so many balls that I don't really feel like I can change a lot to my game. Certainly having someone in my box cheering on for me will help me, but it's not really my main focus right now. My main focus is to improve physically. I think today, considering my flu, arriving just yesterday, I can see already the improvement physically. I mean, the way I was moving in the second set and the way I handled all those tough rallies, I was really pleased with that. So that's first my main direction, and then if I feel I need to bring out someone on the court with me, I will do the move, but right now it's not my main priority.", , , , ,UNK,UNK, 
247,10291,37467,What would you like to say about the atmosphere? Seems like you have a great fan base here in Turkey.,"I do. I mean, I felt the energy last year. It was so nice to see the success of the tournament, especially for a first year. You never quite know what to expect and how the fans will react and how much attendance and how many people will come and support you. I mean, last year was one of the most successful Championships the tour has had. I was looking forward to experiencing that feeling and the atmosphere and the crowd again this year.","You obviously broke through first at Wimbledon winning there on a pretty fast surface ;more recently in your career big results have come for you on slower courts, especially on clay. Do you think you've sort of evolved into a different sort of player over the years where this is now a better environment for you maybe than the reverse, younger?","I hope not. (Laughter.) No, because my favorite tournaments are on the faster court, and I really want to do well there. It's tough to say. I was in the finals of the Olympics and semis of the US Open. Those are probably two of the fastest courts we play on during the year. I mean, it's all relatively speaking obviously. You want to adjust to wherever you're playing, whether it's slow or fast. Maybe do a few more drills if you're a little late late or slow getting up to the ball when the court is slower.",Did you follow the Lance Armstrong stuff?,A little bit.,Were you shocked? Big cultural icon like that.,"I'm not a big cycling fan. I don't think I've ever made a point to turn it on TV and watch it. I've known his success and what he's achieved obviously. He was a great athlete in what he accomplished and went through being sick and coming back. It's unfortunate, but I guess it happens.",Sort of brings up the question as to whether or not doping is stringent enough in all sports. Do you think the controls are enough in tennis?,Are they enough?,Yes,Yes, 
67,8348,30400, , ,"Crazy, crazy kind of weather out there today. Talk about the match and the conditions, how you were able to prevail.","Yeah, I think the weather was definitely not for the good tennis out there. But no matter what match had to be played, and we both were trying our best out there. Like I said on the court, the most important thing was to find the right balance between being patient and being aggressive. I think I did it well.","You've had such great success at the majors this year, been so consistent in the majors. Do you find yourself at a point where you're as confident as you've ever been playing in the big championships?","I don't question myself. You know, I always believed in myself. I always believe. I'm just going out there and trying my best in every match. You know, it's been working pretty good for me so far.","If you have a matchup with - we don't know yet - but with Caroline, you've been 50/50 with her. You're pretty evenly matched.","Um, yeah, well, it's gonna be tough match for both of them tonight. I don't know who's gonna win yet, Caroline or Dominika. If it's Caroline, she's playing great tennis at the moment. She's been so consistent this year and won a few tournaments in a row. She's very tough opponent. You know, we played few times and we always had tough matches. I'm expecting a very tough one in the semifinal. And even if Dominika wins, we just played a three-setter like few weeks ago. It was a very tough one. No matter who's going through it, it's gonna be a tough challenge, and I'm up to it.","With how many unforced errors she was making, you were talking about being balanced and aggressive. Were you trying to be a little bit more patient because of the errors she had been making?","Well, I don't think she was just making errors for no reasons, you know. Um, I think I was making it difficult for her. She had to go more for her shots. I was trying to, you know, guess where she was playing and reading her game. So I was trying to make it as difficult as possible for her. With those conditions, well, unforced errors, it looks like it's an easy shot. But with the wind going all the different directions and blowing, it's not easy to make those shots. So sometimes you have to make the right choices. I think today I made, you know, right choices where I had just to, you know, put the ball in play and where sometimes I had to step up a little bit and do a little bit more with the ball.",Yes,Yes, 
272,1937,6988,Sachin Tendulkar was the other person who came in at the same time as David. Do you know who Sachin is?,I don't.,How difficult is trying to do the French Open/Wimbledon double?,"Well, this is only my second time trying to do that. Of course, the transition, it's no secret, it's very difficult. But I'm quite happy with the way I've gone about things so far. You never know what to expect. Each match poses its different challenges. I'm happy I've gone further than last year, erasing those memories and trying to form new ones.",They've installed a gate on Centre Court so that the players can't climb up onto the box when they celebrate. What do you think of that? Do you think that will ruin a Wimbledon tradition?,I heard you can open the gate. Gates usually open also.,So you're not worried?,I'll worry about it if it happens. That will be a great problem to have.,"You spoke a moment ago about observing other athletes. One of the common dominators of course is rituals and superstitions. What are some of yours, if you had to pick the ones you've had during your career, that stand out the most in your routine?","Yeah, I think it's more of a routine rather than superstitions. I mean, I've been on the tour for so long. I'm experienced enough to know what works for me in terms of preparation and the way I go about things minutes before the match, hours before, nights before, whether it's spending time with your team or having a chitchat right before with your coach as you go on. I wouldn't say they're superstitions but more of rituals and routines that I've carried out, yeah, throughout many years.",UNK,UNK, 
126,18803,68385,How much improvement is there? Still got another five matches to go before the final.,"Well, I'm just taking one match at a time. We're going to see what's gonna happen. You know, every time I step on the court I just want to play better. Today, I'm on the right path.","Were you comfortable coming into the tournament, given you had the couple exhibition losses and then Cibulkova?","I was actually very confident. I was feeling very good. Exhibitions, I just wanted to try a few things out, see how things were working. I lost to Cibulkova, but that's what happens sometimes. I lost last year in Sydney first round as well. Coming in from Hong Kong, play Sydney, it's a bit difficult. I felt I've been practicing really well, really hard. I've been feeling confident and comfortable on the court. I had some good practices after Sydney and feeling good here.",Did you get enough of a break during the off-season and did you actually feel mentally refreshed starting the new year?,"Definitely. I felt like I had a great off-season. Had some time off where I completely relaxed, which was really nice. Then I started working hard, started to build my shape up.","Talking about Cibulkova, you're going to face her again in the third round.","I don't know who she's playing. I know she didn't play yet. You know, I'm not going to say anything about the next match as long as I don't know who I'm playing.",A few words about Kim? What do you think about her for the moment?,"Yeah, I saw her match yesterday on TV. She was playing really well, really aggressively. She showed that she's in good form.",Yes,Yes, 
139,15338,55521,"Today we know that Peng Shuai has a strong will and she is patient. We noticed from the statistics you have over 20 winners. Does that mean that you want to be more aggressive and try to finish the match as soon as possible? For the crownlevel match, we have two Chinese female players. Does that mean that actually this will help us to improve the brand for Chinese players?","Actually, I dont think that much. This is just a simple match for me. I don't have so many thoughts. I just want to try my best.",(Off microphone.),I think no one can make more unforced errors as I did.,Some people say that when you are trying to do some homework prior to the competition it's very much easy for you to lose because you can't get enough information from the opponent. Is that simply because you don't know the opponent before? Does your coach Carlos help you to change you in this regard? You will stick to what you planned in advance even if you are not so familiar with your opponent?,"I can tell you the answer in the future. When I get to know an opponent that I'm not familiar with, I want to repeat again that for female players, actually we are basically equal to each other in terms of competence. Everybody have the chance to win title.",Tomorrow you're going to fight against Radwanska. In North America this year you have already defeated her twice. So can you talk about it?,"I'm very much looking forward to this match, but defeating her in North America means nothing to playing in China Open. Actually, today, you know, Radwanska has no match. And I had a really long match with Peng Shuai. Anyway, I'm happy that Im still continue my match in China Open, so I'm very much looking forward to her match, have a competition with her tomorrow.",Are you going to make any changes with how you approach service tomorrow?,"I wish, but I don't know. You know, like two days ago I have like unbelievable serve, but today I think I got a lot of double faults. This right now still change techniques I have to used to. I always wish I could have good serve in the match today.",UNK,UNK,

I like playing on the American hard courts.  Suits my game.  Sort of battled through my first round here.  Didn't play the best tennis, but I got through that match and then I got better from better with every match from then on. If I keep giving myself opportunities against Roger or Rafa or whoever at the end of tournaments, then sooner or later that's going to fall my way.  The last tow weeks have been good.  It's been real good preparation for me for the US Open.  Couldn't have asked for two better weeks, and it's taken the best guy in the world to knock me off.",11-0 against Federer.  Does that make you even more eager to beat him?,"You got to count the first seven that I won, so it's not that bad.","In your estimation, or mentally for you, how much of a difference is there in coming this close to beating him and actually beating him, you know, going forward confidence-wise?","Yeah, it's another step in the right direction.  Whether or not next time I beat him or not we've got wait and see.  I'm going take -- I took a lot of positives even out of a two-set loss last week to him.  Felt like the ball striking was good. There were certain areas of my game that I could still work on.  I got a good look at his game, and that helped me for this match today.  Got off to a bit of a slow start in the first set.  You got to try and hang with him early, because he's one of the best front runners in the world. So that made at that hard for me.  I had to dig real deep to get out of second set.",Looked like you've added a couple shots to your game recently.  You chip up the line more than I've seen before.,"Yeah, a couple of times.  I guess when you're confident and playing well you start going for more shots and shots that you do on the practice court more than the match court. Yeah, and I felt like I was hitting and seeing the ball well enough out there.  But against a guy like Rog it's not that easy to do the shots you do in practice because he doesn't allow you to do it too often.",UNK,UNK, 
193,942,3463,How do you get back in touch of your roots when you go back there?,"How do I get back in touch?  Have you guys heard of Skype (laughing)?  Actually we stay in touch with my family a lot.  Fortunately, as I said, Skype is one of the great deals where you're able to actually just conference, really, with the rest of my family, and it's been great. But my parents, they try to go back, and my sister tries to go back once in a while.  But I haven't had really the time.  I would love to go back, but it's just -- short on time to do it.",How old were you when you came here?,"I was 13, about to turn 14.  It was April of '96.",You lived in Jacksonville?,Live in Jacksonville still.,And your parents?,My parents still live there.,Where did you go to high school?,Wolfson High School.,Yes,Yes,

(Smiling.)","What about your spirit this year compared to last year? Last year you were clearly a man on a mission. Now it's almost like you're beyond that point, you're somewhere else. Can you talk about that?","Um, well, I feel that, you know, being No.1 and having the best year of my career in 2011 is  you know, I'm playing at the peak of my form and I'm playing the best tennis that I have played. So I have to use that as much as I can, you know, coming into every tournament that I play. The competition is getting stronger, I believe. Everybody is so professional nowadays. You have the top players playing in all the top events, you know. That wasn't the case maybe five, ten years ago. So that makes it even tougher for anybody to win a title. But I'm ready for it, you know. We all, you know, give each other, especially the top players, give each other a reason to improve always and look forward to, you know, to win as many titles as we can.",You seem pretty comfortable with No.1. How do you feel lately on the court? Are you feeling that there is a bigger gap between you and the rest of the players?,"Ah, I mean, there is no gap, you know, really. Every tournament is a new opportunity for all the players to win a title. That's how I look at it. Rankings, you know, I don't need to say too much. You have different surfaces, different seasons that, you know, are more suitable to different kind of players. So, you know, clay court is  obviously Nadal and Spanish players, South Americans, are the ones who have, in past couple of years, more success than the others, but, you know, I believe that everybody's improving their game on the different surfaces. It's very demanding, you know. I think I have been playing really well on all different kinds of surfaces. Winning the title on grass for me in Wimbledon last year was a great feeling and an important title, you know, for my career.",Did the heat affect the performance today? The heat?,"Well, it was quite warm, you know. It went over two hours, and we had many long rallies, but that's something that you expect when you're playing a tough rival and somebody that has very similar style of the game that I have. You know, our games are based on the baseline and hitting a lot of baseline shots and being very patient and aggressive at times. So, yeah, it was tough, you know, at some times. But I think we both felt really good physically.","Practice court session before the game against Monaco, you hit a home run. Are you a baseball fan? How much is having fun part of your game plan?","Honestly, I'm not a big fan of baseball. I'm a fan of hitting the home runs with a tennis racquet on the practice sessions. (Smiling.) We try to come up with some crazy ideas and invent new sports on the tennis court. Yesterday we played a little tennis hockey, if you want to call it, or whatever, on the practice. So we like having fun. I mean, sometimes that brings good energy and, you know, makes you relax a little bit and don't think about pressure and expectations and knowing that you have to, you know, fight for a title but still enjoying a little bit in the offcourt activities.",No,No, 
18,13915,50584,Which of the majors do you think you have the best chance of winning?,"I don't know. I think if I continue to play like that, I have a chance. I like to play on clay courts, I like to play on hardcourts. I don't know. We'll see what will happen. I just want to continue to work hard and to keep building, you know, my game, and I think I'm getting better and better.",Does it matter to you if you're a top 5 player?,"I don't think, you know, for me at this moment -- the ranking doesn't really matter to me. I'm looking to playing some good tennis and really doing the right things out there. And if I'm doing that, you know, I'll be winning big titles and ranking will come on its own. I'm looking to do well in the big events. That is my goal now, and that's something I want to do. I will try my best to achieve that and not really think about ranking or whatever, just think about my game and what I can do to get better as a player.",You won in Cincinnati last year. Your father was architect of that strategy. Did you get any advice from your mother today?,"My mom is very supportive. You know, I cannot say she's the coach because she doesn't really get involved so much when it comes to the tennis game. But she's very, very positive woman, always gives me positive energy and always is there even when I'm down, when I'm winning. She always gives me words of encouragement and is always there for me. So I really appreciate, you know, her help. It means a lot to me to have her in my box.", , , , ,Yes,Yes, 
114,13102,47758,"Do you feel like other players are less intimidated by you as a very high ranked, very top player on hard court right now because they think you have more solid results on clay for the last couple of years, so they are free to play their best and they want to beat you like with more determination?","Well, I think players that are maybe not in the top 10 that are facing somebody in the top 5 or top 10, it's always they go into the match with a very different mentality than if they're, you know, maybe at a different event on a court 18 playing against someone that's not ranked in the top 10. I think you have seen, I mean, I have in my career, seen many different cases of that when you go out to play a top player, they are very free, they go for their shots. At the end of the day they know if they lost the match that was a bit expected from them. So the level that they produce is very high, and that's always one of the toughest things about being on top is that everyone that goes and plays against you will always you have to expect them to play their best tennis no matter if they're ranked in top 10 or not.","(Through translation.) During the two matches that you have played in Wuhan Open, I stand near the coach side, and I always heard that the coach will say that, Come on, Maria. We wonder whether you have heard these kind of words and did you find encouragement from those words?","Yeah, of course you sometimes hear it. Depends if you want to hear it or not (smiling). Depends on the situation. But, yeah, I have a really encouraging team.","(Through translation.) Now three out of four top seeds haven't got through the third round. Do you feel there is anything special for you to, it's hard to get used to in Wuhan like the surface, the court, the venue or the player service or something like that?","I think it would be pretty low from player standards to blame player service or anything else for a loss. I think all the players have been very impressed with the facilities and everyone that's contributed to this tournament. I felt very welcomed from the drivers to the people taking you out on court. Everyone has been super friendly. Facilities themselves I think speak, you know, they speak for itself, because they're great. And with the new stadium coming, I thought the surface was great. I really enjoyed it. I'm certainly not blaming the loss on any of those things.", , , , ,No,UNK, 
208,21012,76458,Which is basically like going to Chipotle?,"Basically, yeah (smiling).","Watching you on the court today, you were really serious, really focused. Nothing like the person we're seeing now. Is that a real conscious effort to not be your normal self but your player self on the court?","Yeah. I think for me sometimes if I allow myself to get too down on myself or if I let, you know, my emotions on the court more so, it doesn't help me. So I try to stay more serious and more focused on the court.","As you get more experienced and kind of more used to all this, might we see more of the real you on court in time?",I'm sure the real me will come out a couple of times throughout my career. But hopefully gonna try to keep the serious Madison on court more often., , , , ,Yes,Yes, 
82,550,2090,Sure.,"Yeah, of course. I'm a human being so I have regrets. Certainly not figuring it out earlier, but I didn't. You know, I certainly don't lose sleep over it, but, yeah, I regret not being able to mature quicker than a lot of other people. But I didn't.",Is 29 the new 19?,"I don't think I'll feel 19 tomorrow morning when I wake up, but, look, you only get better. You only get more and more experience, in my opinion.",Can you describe the difference between thinking you can win and knowing you can?,"I'll try. The difference, what I felt, was I played him at Wimbledon. I served the opening game. I lost serve in 45 seconds at 15, and wasn't unbelievably surprised. You know, I was like, Oh, not a good start kind of thing. I was down 15-40 here and I felt like I left maybe one or two points out there in those four points. I felt like I wanted a better start than Wimbledon. It's just that small belief that I really felt like I could win. Not that I wanted to win, I really felt like I could and maybe should win in that scenario. That's best that I can do.","When you broke at 3-2 in the second, what do you tell yourself to not get too far ahead of yourself given the magnitude of the situation, a possible first win against Nadal?","Helps that I played a lot of big matches in the past couple weeks. If I had just been in that situation, you know, if that would have been the first time, I would have been really nervous. I played a couple nervous points, but I was pretty happy with the way I executed. That first point or two in the last game was huge. I got a little lucky. I hit the top of the tape and maybe the side of the line on a defensive forehand crosscourt and maybe caught him off guard and he missed his slice out wide. A little bit of luck and a little bit of belief as well.",What message were you trying to send to the crowd with your gesture afterward?,"It was a hug thing. Supposed to be a hug. Something that I've done. I saw Jonas Bjorkman do it at Wimbledon a long time ago, and I thought that that was a pretty special moment for him. I clearly copied off him. I've done it here a few times. I had unbelievable crowd support, and I felt it and I wanted to show it.",Yes,Yes, 
200,18359,66672,"Is he more X and is Os, or is he more sort of emotion, feeling?","Like a game plan, Xs and Os?","Yeah, like strategy.","I'm not really great with strategy, like certain strategies. I hate to say it, but I think it's more -- I think it's just more of a different voice and a different perspective. He's also coached against me, and, you know, he's coached against other players, as well. So it's -- I don't know. It's new; it's fresh; I'm enjoying it. Yeah.","When you arrive at one tournament to the next, just before things start, do you have the same sort of feeling mentally and all that, one tournament to the next? Or do you feel that, Oh, God, here I can do really well; I think this could be a good week for me? Or this is not really working out the way I wanted to? How do you feel from one tournament to the next?","I think it always changes. Because especially when you have back-to-back tournaments, it's a good way to, you know, see what worked and what didn't work in the previous tournament, what you feel like you might need to work on. You always get a better idea of things when you're playing matches, so you're more aware of things and you know what to work on more than maybe when you came into the first tournament after only practicing for three weeks or -- you know, having the tournament I think really helps you.","Coming into here, how did you feel?","Coming into here? I was just really excited to play. I was out of competition for a while. I hadn't played tournaments since Australia. I was really eager. To be honest, I was getting really sick of practicing, so I was just really happy that there was a tournament.","We of course are here in California. Glamour, cutting age, diversity. In what ways do you see yourself as a Californian?","Um, it's interesting, because I spent so much time in Florida growing up, and, you know, because of Michael living in Los Angeles, I ultimately bought a place there. So being able to have, you know, both of those has been really interesting. They're both very different. I mean, my house is pretty -- on a quieter side of Los Angeles, so it's more of a beach town. In some ways it's similar to Florida because it's quite relaxed, and I don't think I see a human being, maybe five miles from my house. So it's really quiet, and it's nice. I think you go there, you have the house, and, you know, you practice there. It's kind of like you eat, breathe, and sleep tennis in a way, because that's where I grew up and that's all I did when I was there, so that's the only memories that I have of going there. And then, I mean, California is very different. I think it's a little bit younger and maybe fresher, and you have different parts of it and many places to visit. It's fun. I have been on vacation in different parts of it. Napa is actually one of my favorites. Yeah.",UNK,UNK, 
101,10751,39116,Cibulkova was eliminated in the first round. Bouchard was eliminated in the first round. Li Na was defeated. And you are the fourth semifinalist.,"Well, I think this is tennis. I think every week it's a different story and different matches. I think in that level, you can see different scores, and, you know, different conditions here than Australia. But, you know, I don't think this is any you know, it's not going together. Australia was few weeks ago, and that was different tournament. Well, it's just, you know, probably a little bit slower surface than Australia. Maybe some different players play a little bit better on that. But I think it doesn't go together.",Until now you had an easy tournament. You have won easily your game. Is it a problem before the semifinals or not?,"Well, I have easy scores, but, you know, it doesn't really mean I have easy matches. I played great tennis, especially today. I think, you know, Yanina is a really tough opponent. Every time we play I have to really push myself 100% to beat her. I think today I was playing really, really good tennis. I cannot complain about anything today. Of course I think it's much, much better if you have easy, short matches, especially when you play every day. So you are still fresh in the end of the week, so I'm very happy about that.",Can you just look at your semifinal matchup and talk about her?,"Well, I played Simona a few times, last time in Rome on clay, so a bit different conditions, of course. But, well, I think she really had great season last year, having some really good results, and as well here I saw her playing a couple of matches, also. Today she was playing unbelievable. Well, for sure tough match, but it's a semifinal, so I think there is a little bit less pressure, because, you know, this is a really good score, and now I think everyone is going to play good. I'm really looking forward, and for sure it will be tough one.", , , , ,Yes,Yes, 
175,16254,58902,Compared to maybe last year.,"Last year, yes.","Last year, yes.","Yeah, I think I'm just playing more freely overall and with more confidence because I can get to more balls without thinking. I can wake up in the morning without feeling sore. I can go to bed not feeling like, I hope I feel better tomorrow. I don't have these thoughts going through my mind and I'm not worried sort of every single sort of minute of the day. So automatically you're more inspired and you're more happy as a person then in the process, for sure.","After the Anderson game you talked about how before that match you saw the weather and you thought, Maybe it will be windy. You said you've been through that before. Is there anything you haven't seen like weatherwise and conditionswise?","Well, I mean, we don't play in ice cold conditions, thankfully, tennis players, because, I don't know, it doesn't work for us. It's not like other sports. Where they play NFL I saw a game when I was practicing in Dubai and there was snow just everywhere. I was like, That's crazy. I don't know how they do it. Thankfully I'm a tennis player, I thought. But then again, we play in unbelievable heat sometimes, like in Australia. We had four days of extreme heat. Wind, I have had it, you know. Playing in the rain I think is always tough on the clay. It's just tough for everybody involved, fans, us, conditions, ball boys. You name it, everybody doesn't have a great time. So it's part of what we do. Clearly it also took me a while to get used to all these conditions, you know. I think wind and humidity is probably one of the tougher ones out there.",Would you say the experience that you had was a little bit of an edge for you today?,"I mean, I think Alexandr has also seen a lot, so maybe a slight advantage. I'm not sure. You would have to ask him.",Wondering if there is any added significance for you having played this well here this year since this is where things went sour for you. Does that make it any sweeter this year?,"Not necessarily. You know, I accepted the fact that I wasn't feeling well last year. I knew I had planned to go back after this tournament and then rest and prepare. So instead of resting I was just sore. Instead of preparing, I was just trying to get back. So it was a bit of a wasted sort of stretch for me instead of coming out feeling like, you know, sort of at the top. I didn't feel that way. That's when I had the aftereffect I think for a few weeks, maybe. I did return okay. Once the clay came around at least the pain was gone, but mentally I took a hit, I think, just knowing that I never felt in pain for that long like I did after this tournament last year. So it feels good winning again here so many matches. I think it's nice winning anyway (smiling). It just solves a lot of problems and makes you feel better, you know, happier.",Yes,Yes, 
55,17525,63516,"You got on top of her early, which I guess is somewhat important, got up 30, and then she had a hard time pushing you at all, yes?","Yeah, so I definitely started early. I always try to do that in every match. I try to win as many games as I can. Doesn't always work out, but that's always what I try to do.",What do you think of your level overall since you first got here till the end? Pleased?,"Yeah, I'm okay. Definitely can do a lot more. For me, it's always about constantly improving and never saying I did great and I can be satisfied. For me, it's like I did great but what can I do better? What can I improve on? That's what I always strive for.",So the glass is always pretty much half empty every day?,"It's not necessarily half empty. It's more or less it's more or less what can I do to be better. I think whenever I become satisfied, then that's when I think a lot of players, in general, the level goes down. For me, throughout my whole career, I've always tried to constantly do better.","You showed a lot of respect to your partners on court. But it seemed to me personally that it was like slow motion between the plays, and then you played so easily all your matches here like two last matches that I said there were no opposite on the court. Is just kindness to your partners in tennis, to the people that you meet in tennis, or is just how you feel? Because it seemed to me it was too easy, this tournament.","No tournament is ever easy, especially being in the position I am in. You have to you know, the tournament starts and they expect you to win. The tournament is like, Well, you're going to be in the final. After your semifinal I want you to do this, and you have to do this and this press. It's like, Who knows if I'll even make it to the semifinals? It's a lot of pressure and it's not easy. So everything is, for me, a bonus and a blessing to get so far.",Obviously you hide it. Thank you very much. You hide like you're tired or you're nervous. I didn't see it. So thank you.,"Yeah. You know, I'm a sports athlete, and I have to perform. People come to watch myself and my opponent play, so you have to be able to perform. That's all I could do.",No,No, 
109,20741,75325, , , , ,"With the rain delay and everything like that, must be nice to get on and off the court quickly in your first grass match?","Well, I don't know if it's nice to go on and off, but I think I would prefer to stay longer and stay and play during the whole match. But doesn't matter. It's same for both of us. No, I mean, here we are, and that's quite usual. I mean, I think it's a preparation for Wimbledon with everything, you know. Especially these tough moments, it's also good to know how to handle that, and I did it quite well. So I'm happy for it.","How difficult is it to get your footing when it's still a fresh grass court? Does it enter your mind that, you know, it could be a bit dangerous, or do you allow yourself to think you've got to be careful?","Well, actually for me it's always dangerous on the grass especially, and I always falling down. And actually I have still in good memory my match from the Olympic Games where the fresh grass was really fresh, and I was always on the ground. I think maybe I was more on the ground than on my feet. So even that, this was really improvement and it was not actually that bad. I mean, yes, these courts are amazing, but when you get a rain delay, you know, before they put the cover, there is still a bit of rain that gets on the court, when they pull it off. You know, it takes some time when the grass is really, really, you know, dry and you can really run on that. It's same for both of us. I did it quite well today.",You just joined Twitter. Talk about it. Why did it take you so long to join up?,"I don't know. I mean, I was like still I don't know. I didn't pay attention to that too much, but then just somebody like show it to me what it is and how that works, and it was pretty good fun or it's still pretty good fun. You know, I mean, it's something to taking my, you know, free time during the days and weeks and in the tournament, and so far it's just by the days. It's pretty cool, pretty fun.",UNK,UNK,may be no
213,15849,57548,What makes your game work better when you can't serve as well? Do you concentrate more or do something differently knowing you can't serve as you might want to?,"Yeah, it's always worse because this is kind of shot that you really using and sometimes you can really serve well and winning the match because of the serve. I have opposite thing, you know. It's kind of hard. But, like I said, those courts are not really fast, so you can really -- the serve is not the biggest weapon on those matches. You know, I can just really play with my forehand and backhand.","Starting the second set, you win 10 games in a row. What changed during that period of the match?","Well, I think I was just more relaxed. I had some chances, of course, in the first set as well. But I just thought I really have nothing to lose. She's playing well. This is the semifinal. You know, I'm just gonna play till the end and fighting till the last point. I was really starting playing much better, playing aggressive, pretty much no mistakes. I really felt very good second and third set. Obviously she was start to play incredible in the third set. I think I didn't really change anything. She was just playing unbelievable.","So when she got back to 4-3, were you thinking, No way she maintains this level? Or were you thinking, Now I might have to raise my game even more?","Like I said, 4-3, I didn't really change anything. She was start to play so much better, really like no mistakes, she was like going for it. Every game was very close. Even when I won those 10 games in a row. It looks like the same in the first set, but those games were just going to my side. But, you know, also was a good game on my side when it was 4-3. I had a couple good shots. It was pretty close in the end, yes.","One, it doesn't look like you get very tired. Only a couple times when you were running. Number two, it looked like you were playing inside the court, trying to push her back. You were dictating a lot of the points.","Yes, I was trying to do that. She's also a good runner. She's really going for it. I was actually trying to do the same, just playing aggressive, try to make the winners, as well. I think that was the key of this match.",I could hear you joking with the crowd afterwards about Starbucks. Can you talk about that.,"Yeah, you know, when I came here the first day, I was very sleepy and tired. I don't know why. It was the middle of the day. I could feel like it was already in the evening. I'm not the coffee person. I don't like coffee. But I really had to have one because I was so sleepy. So I went there to have mocha. Actually, like iced mocha. I really loved it. It was really a good one (laughter). I won the match the next day. So I said, Okay, let's go for another mocha. It was so good. Then I won again. Then, okay, again mocha. Till now I had those couple mochas. Actually I'm going to go today, as well. Like I said on the court, I think I need a double mocha today.",UNK,No,UNK?
38,19864,72124,Really?,Yeah.,Have your family traveled with you before? They're over here en bloc? How many family have you got with you?,"Well, I mean, my mom, my dad, my sister, my immediate family. My sister has two friends over here, my friend's over here, one of my cousins was here. But they come to a lot of tournaments. They were at -- they've been to Australia before, they came to San Jose, Memphis, Indian Wells, they came to Davis Cup in Serbia, came over here. They come to a lot of tournaments during the year, which is fun.",Was that the problem when you sort of high-tailed it out of Roland Garros? Had you just sort of had enough of being on your own and Europe and everything?,"I just had played -- that was like my fifth, I mean, really like my sixth week in a row because I got there a week before Rome. I had played a lot -- two weeks before that, I played five matches in Houston. So just a lot of tennis, and I think I just physically and mentally needed a little bit of a break.",What did you do between then and now to refresh yourself?,"After the French Open I didn't play tennis or work out for a full week. Then I hit for like two days and then flew over here. I mean, I hit -- I've hit 10 million tennis balls in my life, so if I don't hit for a week, it won't really hurt my game. But, you know, I practiced for three, four days before this tournament and came out there feeling great.",Do you find London a more agreeable environment than some of their European cousins?,"Yeah. No, it's nice, because I'm staying in a house the whole time in Wimbledon for a month and you kind of settle it. You can unpack, get groceries at the grocery store, eating breakfast at the house every morning. You know, there is Nintendo so I can play that. There's like a fun pool, there's a trampoline. It feels more like home, which is a nice feeling.",Yes,UNK, 
164,18518,67261,What are your thoughts on that?,"It's pretty simple.  I think I beat myself up out there, so I didn't do much, right things.  I was just playing within myself, and I lost the match and this is it.",She's beaten quite a few top players.  What is it about her game that's so difficult?,"For me, it wasn't about her game.  She played well, but I was not doing anything to win the match.  And playing like this, I think I deserve to lose today.","Were you not feeling okay, or was something wrong?","I was feeling fine.  I was feeling fine.  It's the way I was thinking on the game.  The way I prepare for the game and everything, it wasn't right. I've got to learn to do it right way next time during Grand Slams.  It's lots of pressure.  I got to handle it and got to play well and do it differently, you know.  Otherwise, it will happen to me many times.  You know, I got to learn a lot from this lose and definitely a very disappointed one, but I got to go with it.  So that's it.",You say you weren't thinking right.  What were you thinking then?,"Well, it's my problems, you know, what I was thinking of.  But, no, I got to just take a different way.  You know, Grand Slam is very hard.  Lots of things around, which I really have to get more distance from that and just focus on the game, and that's it.",Is it mental pressure that got to you?,"Well, the mental pressure, I don't know.  Because the pressure, you make it yourself.  If I had pressure I put it on me myself, and I'm responsible for that and for this lose. I mean, the way I've been on the court I didn't deserve to win today, is this is what happens.  I got learn from it and just try to improve it next time.",No,No,negated question
93,15325,55481,What do you expect this year for your ranking?,"I want to try and improve it. I think the clay court season will be very important for me. On the hardcourts, I think my game is up there with the top guys. On grass it definitely got better last year. But on clay, it hasn't been the same as them, and that's where they have picked up sort of a lot of the points and stuff. If you got rid of the clay court season's points, I think I would be very close to Roger, and not too far behind Rafa. I need to improve my results on clay. If I do that, there's a chance I'll get higher.","When you closed out the eighth game with the world's slowest ace, 76 miles an hour, were you amused, or surprised?","No. Sometimes, you know -- I mea, if you hit a big -- obviously it didn't look that fast. If you watched it, there was a lot of kick and it landed pretty short in the box. I don't think I had used that serve once the whole match. So, no, I mean, I don't know if he gave up on the serve or not, but I wasn't really thinking anything apart from I had won the game.",Was there an extra benefit to staying at home in your own place?,"Well, it's just nicer away from the court. I mean, I don't think it affects your performance too much when you're playing the matches. I just think it's much nicer sort of on your off days, which there are quite a few during these tournaments, that, yeah, you can just chill. You don't have to be in a hotel. You can sort of have food at your apartment and you don't always have to go out for dinner. That's a big difference to most weeks on the tour.",Do you feel when you were serving for the second set that that was basically almost like match point?,"No, because, I mean, the wind did pick up in the second set as well from the end where I had to serve to stay in the set from at 5-4. The wind was right in my face. Like I say, he was rushing me a bit. If he hit a few big shots it would have been tough for me. I knew that he was struggling there, and if I could keep points long and not make any silly mistakes... You know, I think I hit a big ace at 30-All in that game. You know, that sort of calmed me down a little bit.", , ,Yes,Yes, 
57,12728,46265,"After you failed to convert your first mathchpoint you seemed to lost the count, the result.",I thought it was 6-5 and then 6-All.,Doesn't happen very often.,"Yeah, happens sometimes, you know.  Happens in practice all the time.  In a match you got the umpire, thank God.","What was your reaction to the game of Seppi?  I mean, were u more or less surprised by the way he played, or not?","Well, I thought his serve was not very good in the beginning, you know.  I thought it was very average actually.  That started to become better as the match went on.  I thought his forehand was very good.  He hits it good inside out.  He hits it good from the forehand corner.  That's why he's a good player. And you know, his backhand, he can take it early, too.  Yeah, he's tough from the baseline and he can slice and dice.  He's a very good all-around player.  Didn't know exactly what to expect because I've never played him.  Now I know and I think he's a good player.","Your next opponent has had a couple good wins, Lee.  What do you make of his game?","Played once against him I think in 2003 in Wimbledon, first round maybe.  That was one time on grass, so not too much I can say about his game.  Just that I know that he usually plays quite close to the baseline, half volleys a lot.  Plays pretty flat, so you would think clay is his weakest surface.  Probably he never played on clay when he was growing up.  Maybe that's going to be an advantage for me.  I don't know.  He beat Youzhny and that's a great win.  We will see what happens on Thursday.",Has there been any reaction to you -- you say you haven't spoken to Etienne personally -- but to what you said yesterday and the way it was delivered?  Has there been any reaction inside or outside tennis to what you said yesterday?,"Well, I received a letter from the ITF.  They, of course, want to meet me.  Same thing with -- but he was going to come anyway.  Etienne wasn't planning to come but he decided to come, which I think is very good. We're going to be meeting later on tonight.  And, yeah, there's just been talks in the locker room as usual the last few weeks and months. It's just now a bit intense because it's a much more open conversation.  I think what was written in the press is what we said yesterday, so it's actually -- it was okay.",UNK,UNK, 
255,166,548,So basically you wanted to hit more balls? Are you feeling just a little bit lack of match play?,"No. I just didn't have a great rhythm. It's sometimes nice just to be able to come off the court and groove, just to get a good hit on the ball. Conditions were a little bit tricky from one end, and, you know, balls were flying a bit. I just wanted to get a good rhythm again.","Back to the match play, I think you have had three matches after Roland Garros last year and now six. Is that enough for you?","I'm hoping that it is. You know, I still feel like in certain situations I am a bit rusty and I'm not closing it out when I have to or maybe going for a little much or overthinking it a bit. That will come. I'm not worried about that. Those are the as long as I feel like I'm doing the right things and I'm playing the way I want to play, if I'm making those types of errors, they are going to go in eventually.","Can you tell us what sort of recovery is different after playing in 40 degree heat? Also, how long did it take you to actually feel normal again?",Just a lot more ice baths and a lot more like hand treatment and hot and cold baths. Just a lot of things. I was just really working my physio. He had a long evening.,"You raced to a great start in the first set. Would you say the second set, would you say it was a drop in intensity for you or did she play better?","A little bit. I think it's a combination of both. I think there are a few different times where I think I could have taken control of the match. You know, one of those is in the third game of that second set where, you know, I felt like I was doing the right things, playing solid, you know, moving forward. And then once I lost that game I think my concentration dropped a little bit. Then I got it going again. So there was a few ups and downs, and that's something that I definitely want to eliminate going forward.",The Olympics is coming up real soon. I understand you're going to have a gig as a commentator with NBC. Can you talk about that? Excited about that?,"Everyone seems to think I will be commentating on winter sports. I'm not a bobsledding expert (Laughter.) I will confirm I won't be commentating. I'm going to be showcasing the city of Sochi to a worldwide audience, and we will be doing a few segments. I'm going to be with a few different cohosts around the city, in the village, and then I'm going to be a doing a few segments in the studio with Bob Costas, as well.",Yes,Yes, 
140,6314,23230,Did you think if you do get back up to the top where you were before that you're in a better position now to stay there for a longer run?,"I really believe so. You know, I think in true career everyone goes through tough moments, and those moments make you stronger. You can learn from it and then you can -- even if it start happening, you can catch yourself much earlier and make some changes and adjustments. So I do think overall I will manage to handle it better.","You were talking about your coach yesterday and how she's helped with you your fitness. Has she done anything other than just the fitness, though? Has anything else helped you?","Yeah, I mean, just having fun, you know. She's a girl, so we can go shopping together, watch movies, do our nails. (Laughing.) It just keeps your mind off tennis. Because, you know, in the past, you're with male coaches, and you do a job and go back to the room. I really like to read. It was sort of relaxing. But then after all, you spent all day in a room, and it gets kind of depressing. So it's good to go out and just do a fun girly stuff.",Have you been able to do any of that stuff here this week?,We've been already to cinema twice and to shopping mall for frozen yogurt. All kinds of things trying to enjoy any time off we have.,What movies did you see?,I saw salt and The Other Guys.,Did you like them?,"It was fun, yeah. We had this huge bowl of popcorn.",Yes,Yes, 
180,10884,39686,"With the majors still to go, do you feel in order to live up to your expectations, you need to make the final or the semifinals of one of those tournaments to compete with Nadal and Federer that have been so dominant this season?","Yeah, I mean, that's what you're aiming to do.  My expectations are to go out there and to try to play well and do the right things.  I'd love to win a Wimbledon sometime.  I've been so close before.  That's probably my primary goal in my career at this point. Right now my focus is on this tournament and preparing for that.  I'm not really thinking about Wimbledon yet.  US Open's a long way away as far as my thought process goes.","When you're playing at a club like this where you're so close to the fans, what has it been like this week walking around with a coach that's arguably more famous than you?","It's not ""arguably"" (laughter).  There's no argument there. My brother and I laugh.  We'll be walking around.  They'll come up, ""Remember that match you played against this guy in 1977?""  He kind of has a running history of every match he's played.  I don't know if he remembers all of them, but he pretends to (smiling).",Does he spend a lot of time talking to you about his time at Wimbledon and giving you advice?,"Never.  You have to ask him questions about his playing career for him to talk about it.  At the Open last year, it wasn't, ""I use the crowd to get you going.""  It's like, ""Use the New York crowd to your advantage.""  It's never really about him, which I guess is the purpose of a coach. It's amazing kind of how little he discusses it.",Do you have any television recollections of him on Wimbledon grass?,"Probably not Wimbledon, besides videos.  You know, I'm not sure when he made his last run at Wimbledon.  I was actually at the Open in '91 when he made his run.  Kind of just what I've seen on tapes and stuff.  I don't remember it from when I was younger.",Have you ever seen the old racquet?,The T2000?,No,No, 
31,1270,4635,How did you feel going into the match? Were you nervous to play Serena or were you feeling quite comfortable out on the court from the first point?,"I played her in Beijing and I really afraid her because she's a great player and it's really tough to play against her. But this time, I don't know, yeah, I felt so comfortable. I really like thought that I could beat her. So, yeah, maybe in my head that helped me.",Was there some change mentally? People say tennis happens in the head very much.,"Yeah, that's true. But, I don't know, it's just different maybe feeling. But we also worked with my coach for the mentally. I think it helps.",Does your last name mean anything? Sounds a little bit like macaroni in Italian.,"I know, but I don't like it. When sometimes you are playing, the crowd, they start, Macarena or Macaroni, I don't like it really, so...",You don't like the macaroni or...,"No, the Italian food, I really like it (smiling). I don't like how they call sometimes. Because in Russia, it's really popular family name. The international people, they didn't understand. That's okay. I'm used to it.",Can you talk a little bit about closing out that first set. You had a few set points. Were you a little nervous at that point?,"No, I don't think so, that I was nervous. Maybe I was nervous like when it was 4030. But when it was 40Love, I didn't nervous. But she played also good. We had a long point. I missed. But that's the game. Of course I'm thinking that I could win the set, but I didn't nervous that much.",UNK,UNK, 
258,22551,81946,"Were you training outside, too?","No, I was staying inside. It was too cold. I don't want to get sick.","You have been very successful in Tokyo. I don't know if you know it or not, but that tournament will be replaced by China. Could you give us any comments on that.","Well, definitely I was really playing good in Tokyo a couple times. I think that surface there was a little bit faster and I was enjoying it, playing also great tennis every year there. But, well, for sure it's also good thing that we can play in different city. But, well, it was always good memories to go back there. But now there's no choice.","Speaking of the next round against Li Na, will you approach that match with the same strategy? Seems last time it went down very well. She's also on a very good momentum at this time.","We played I think like 10 days ago. But it's always tough against her. She's always playing very solid tennis. I think I really have to play aggressive against her, definitely serving good, really playing my hundred percent the best tennis; otherwise I'm not going to win, for sure.","You and Li Na don't have very strong serve. In your mind, who got a better one?","Okay, what was the question again?","You and Li Na don't have very strong serve obviously. But in your mind, who has the better one?","Well, I think in our matches it's not about the power on the serve. I think we both have other shots, other type of games that we are good at. That's why, you know, even against the players that's serving 200 per hour, we still can be able to beat. You know, tennis is not about the serve only.",UNK,No,UNK?
78,18203,66125,"Other than the result, what was the difference in the way you two played the first set compared to here and New Haven?","Well, she played a lot better than there, I guess.  She already know how I play and she start to play another game.  I didn't play as good as I played there, so that's of different today.","Obviously not the result you would want to do, but are you pleased with your performance as far as you were able to get this week, or last week and into this week?","Well, I played this tournament not bad.  I mean, I played good my matches.  I made some mistake with the tactic and I couldn't play my best game, so last week was much better. I was more fit and I was just in a good shape and that's it.","Describe the way she's playing right now.  Is she in your estimation playing top-tier tennis?  I mean, is she going to be very hard to beat?","She's playing really, really good now.  She has a good chance to be in the final I guess.  She has everything, like serve good, big forehand.  Big, big forehand and backhand also good.  She's tough mentally, so I think she has good chances on this tournament.","When you say you played the wrong tactic, what tactic would you say you tried that didn't work exactly?","I played too much to her forehand.  I should play next time a little bit more to her backhand, especially when it's important point or when I'm attacking and going to the net.  It's much better to attack to her backhand and then go to the net instead of the forehand.", , ,Yes,Yes, 
192,16145,58545, , , , ,This is your third Grand Slam fourth round.  Was that your best win of your career?,"By a result, of course.  I never beat -- I beat two times top 10 player, but not top five.  First time for me to reach the quarterfinal.  I was playing good today.  I just went there and gave everything, played my game.  I'm happy the way I played.",What did you like about your game today?  Any particular aspect of your game?,"I mean, I started very bad serving.  By the match was going more and more.  I served very well.  I had over 70% first serve in the second set.  Very effective.  I was very aggressive.  Three weeks ago I lost from a rain delay when I was leading 6-4, 5-1.  Finally the rain didn't affect anything on my game.  I just went there and took my points.",Had you talked to Dudi Sela with his experience in the rain against Marat Safin?,"Unfortunately I was there watching in the box.  I mean, we just learned from it.  Like I said, three weeks ago, it happened to me.  I hope he will learn about it.  It was unlucky.  Next time I hope he will go out there like Safin did and go and take his chances.",Yes,Yes, 
125,20048,72820,You felt like playing against her you had to do more?,"Yeah, I played like I want to play something unbelievable, every shot I want to do the good shot. But sometimes you just have to play just simple, maybe just through the middle. But actually when I played through the middle, then she started to make winners. That's why maybe I was trying too much. It wasn't my day today.",She made 87% of her first serves.,"Exactly, yeah. I remember only once I returned on the second serve.",Have you ever played anyone who served as well as she did?,"Actually, I think she has like one of the best serves on tour. That's why it's difficult to return, so...",How surprised would you be if Serena didn't win the tournament?,"Well, I don't care now, to be honest.", , ,UNK,UNK, 
242,18093,65699,"If I may, let me ask you about the Olympics and Tibet. There are a handful of athletes from various places if various sports from around the world who said they will protest in various ways because of the situation in Tibet.",Uh-huh.,"Boycotting the opening ceremonies, wearing ribbons perhaps, that kind of thing. Is that something that you would think about doing, along those lines?","No, not so far. I don't think I will. Honestly, I don't know enough about the situation. I don't know how much we athletes should be involved in this, you know. That's why we'll see how it goes. I've been asked this question for the first time like a month ago, and didn't hear anything about it. I hope it's not going to have any effect on the Games, because it should be a celebration of sport and not using it for political reasons, you know. We'll see how it goes. I definitely will go, and I hope everything will be all right.",Do you have any concerns about the air quality in Beijing? American runners are saying...,"Not really, to be honest with you. We are holding a tournament there many, many years in Beijing. Never heard of any problems. I think I heard they're going to try their very best to keep the air as clean as possible. I know it will be tough, but I have no reasons to be nervous for that.",You may have Andy Roddick again in the next round. Are you ever wondering the law of averages will catch up to you with him?,"Well, he's beaten me before, but I have a definitely a very, very good record against him. Toughest places to play against him is always in America. I've had some close ones here with him over the years. A guy I always enjoy playing against, we have a lot of respect for each other. I think it will be a great matchup for this tournament if he were to play in the next round.","When you had mono, did you ever think of Mario Ancic and the fact he missed like six months?","For some reason I didn't think of him, no, because it was over before it started for me. I heard I had it, and two weeks later they said it was gone.",No,No, 
115,18181,66034,Looked like you were almost celebrating a championship out there. How good did it feel?,"I was really happy, you know. It was great winning for me, and I think in the third set I was a little bit nervous when I starting to think too much about closing the match. So I'm really proud of my game today, and I just want to enjoy this moment now.","She was building back momentum in that final set, had gotten it back to tied, and then she goes out and throws down a couple of double faults.","Well, she's a good fighter, you know. You can never give up with her. You have to be focused until the last game, until the last point, actually. But I think in 5-4 she's starting to feel a little bit of pressure, also. She has a lot of double faults. But during this season also she played really good, she had good results, but also with the serve she didn't serving like before. So I think she just feeling the pressure.","She paid compliments to you, that you played a very, very smart game out there. She made a lot of errors, no doubt, and gave away a lot of points, but you also earned some points out there. Are you happy?","Well, I think we played really good. We fight a lot and we run a lot both. You know, this match I'm winning for two or three points, no; it was not that much the difference. I just play very aggressive and everything was working really good.",When she double-faulted to begin the final --,I was happy. (Laughter.),How much confidence did you take from that?,"Well, not too much confidence, but I was happy. (Smiling).",UNK,UNK, 
158,20700,75200,"In a tight match like that, what was the difference between you and Serena?","I think she used her chances definitely much better.  You know, she's definitely a great champ.  She played the tight points very well.  I had my opportunities.  I didn't use them.  That was the big difference.","Quite a number of unforced errors on your side, but also a lot of winners.  What was your pregame plan?","You know, I think I struggled on that a little bit today.  Needed to keep the ball in play much more than I did.  I was trying to go for a winner or easy shot too early.  I think that was a little mistake.",How does this semifinal compare with the one at Roland Garros last year?  Do you feel you're a more mature player?,"I mean, two totally different players.  Two totally different occasions, surfaces, everything.  I don't think you can really compare it much.",Were you affected by the sun glare at any stage during the match?,"No, didn't notice anything.",You didn't notice any glare coming towards your eyes during the match?,"Not really.  It was sunny, of course.  But, no, not really crazy that I noticed.",UNK,UNK, 
112,13691,49792,How did the heat affect your game today?,"Not too much, no. I've played in hotter conditions, in Australia. US Open gets pretty hot as well. It is extremely hot today for London. But, yeah, I've played in hotter basically. It wasn't too much of an issue. It's the same with both players to deal with it. It was fine.",Is your shoulder going to be okay for the Davis Cup?,"I don't know. I'd love to predict the future, but I don't know. We'll see. With these sort of things, it's a daybyday thing. Same as with the ab. Progressing is slow. I don't know. I'll keep an eye on it and my trainer will work on it. But, as I say, you get niggles here and there. It's nothing new for me. I've always picked up something now and again. It generally doesn't last that long. We'll just maintain it and keep an eye on it. But Davis Cup is two, two and a half weeks away now. A lot can happen, can change, from now to there.",Am I right in thinking there was a suggestion you might play higher up in the order of the Davis Cup ahead of Ward? Is that correct?,I don't know. It hasn't been talked about with me. I don't know. That's Leon's decision. I really don't know basically.,How much of a shortterm target is it to qualify by right for the main draw at the US Open? How realistic do you think it is?,"It's obviously something I want to do for sure, yeah. I don't know. It will be tough now because the last cut for the entry I think is the week after Wimbledon. If I'm playing something, it will be Davis Cup. If not, my first tournament will be Atlanta. I think at the minute I might just miss out. But it is what it is. Nothing much I could have done in terms of my ab. You just have to deal with it. Yeah, it's just something you have to deal with. I'm sure everyone's job each day is not plain sailing, you have to deal with the obstacles along the way. If I have to qualify, I'll absolutely give it my best. I've had a bit of experience from Australia and Paris now, so it will be another great opportunity for me to qualify for the US Open, if that's the case.","Just to be specific, as far as you are concerned, you are 100% fit without any ab, shoulder, whatever problems when you walked onto court?","Yeah, I felt good going onto court. Same like Paris. If it was going to harm me or do further damage, I wouldn't have walked on court because health is the main priority. You don't want to go in there and do furthermore damage, especially being young and having a long career. So, no, I felt good this morning. It's just one of those things. I guess maybe I was hitting quite a few serves and going for it a bit more. I just felt something. Like I haven't done anything to it. I just felt something so I got the trainer on.",UNK,UNK, 
181,12270,44695,"What is worse, the heat here in Indian Wells or the heat at the Australian Open?","Well, here it's more dry, so when it's a little bit windy, you didn't feel it that much.  Australia, I think sometimes is worse, for sure.","And at the Australian Open, when you made some remarks about how the players were treated or not treated during the intense heat, did that result in any changes to the way matches were conducted in really hot weather?","Well, it's very difficult playing in that conditions.  I mean, it's really heat in there.  It's very, very hot on court.  And if they are play or somebody plays five sets in that conditions, why the other guys don't play at the same time or same condition, as well, it's not fair for the guy who is playing outside and get more tired and irritation.  Everything is much worse.  I think they had to review that rule and try to be 50/50 for all the players.",So you're talking about playing on the shady courts and the outside courts?,Sorry?,Can you explain that a little bit more.  You're talking about people who are playing on the outside courts?,"Yeah, I mean, if you play outside if you start the match, you have to finish the match.  And the guys are playing in the stadiums, they play -- I mean indoors with AC, everything, so that's a big, big difference, condition on court.  And I didn't understand why, if you start playing and the heat is going up, going up, going up, and then they stop the matches, but you have to finish your match, I don't know why.  I mean, I think everybody has to stop.  It's the same thing if it's raining, everybody stop.","One would think that as fit as you seem to be, you would welcome the heat.",Well...,UNK,UNK, 
113,17962,65156,"He had five game points and three shots I could have made, but not at that situation.","I mean, I don't quite remember anymore what happened. I remember I was against the wind and to get the break then was crucial. I think he was maybe up 40-Love on that game. Anyway, I came back and I guess that really gave me momentum. I kind of never looked back.",Did you feel flat at all in the beginning or did he just make you look like that?,"Yeah. That would be him. No, I mean, I was feeling fine. I just had a bad start. I think if I would have maybe been only broken once in the first set, I think I could have challenged him a bit more. He served it out well at 5-4. And being down two breaks against such a good player, that's not going to be enough. That was my problem. Once you start running behind against a player who can take such huge cuts at the ball, he was only getting more and more confident and that made that really, really difficult for me to find rhythm. Yeah, it was tough for me today. I found a way. I'm very happy about my performance in the end.","Since the Olympics, is there always a bit of a feeling that this guys goes crazy and it's going to be very, very tough?",This guy?,Berdych goes crazy and has a fantastic match it's going to be very tough for you or anybody.,"The Olympics, yeah, way back. No, I mean, yeah, I mean, I know the danger of playing Tomas. He's top 3, top 5 guy with most powerful shots in the game. You combine serve, forehand and backhand, it's incredible how he -- the pace he gets with little effort. That's why he's dangerous. Still in the fifth even though he looks like he's beaten. You have to be so careful. Even the last game you saw it. I make one stupid mistake and then all of a sudden he can hit three screamers. I know the danger of playing Tomas. I wish he was higher up in the rankings so you don't have to play him that early. I think today he showed why he could be a wonderful player.","Did you see a scouting report, because he seemed to be more in control when he played Stan the other night than he used to be in the past?","No, I didn't speak to Stan.",UNK,UNK, 
165,19394,70395,"You said it was difficult to play a friend, but you've beaten Lucie six times out of six, so it's more difficult for her than for you. What exactly is so difficult about playing a friend?","I don't know it was more difficult for her. I mean, I was the favorite of the match, of course, and I just really wished to have a 6All, and that's fun definitely [checkaudio]. I mean, it's tough. Emotions are not really bringing out. It's still a little bit more inside you. You are finding inside. I mean, that's something really special to me, to my friend, in the semifinal, Czech friend, of course. I think it was really a great match.","How have you been able to stay the course after the Wimbledon win to now? You haven't changed coaches. You haven't moved to Monaco. You haven't done a lot of things. I'm sorry, you did move to Monaco. You haven't done a lot of things that players have struggled after a big win might do. Talk about that a little bit.","I mean, was really a point when everything change in my life after Wimbledon. I didn't change my tennis coach. I am still with David. I changed some fitness coaches, obviously. I'm working more on my mentally side, of course. That's something what I think really I need, to work on the mentally. When I'm still living with the pressure, that's what I really need to handle it. Yeah, a lot of things change in my life. I'm not any more too much private person. Of course the media are interesting in everything, so that's not easy as well. Yeah, I don't know what else actually.","You had obviously to withdraw at Eastbourne because of the injury. You said it wasn't too serious. It was to make sure you'd be right for Wimbledon. But now at this point, are you pleased you made that decision to do that then? Was there a point when you worried you might not be ready for this tournament?","I play Eastbourne first time against Lucie. It was big fight. Very long match. Next day I start to feel the leg. I play against Lepchenko. I won it, but next day I woke up and I really couldn't walk without the pain. It was something actually I didn't do it before, but I knew it's before the Wimbledon. If I need to recovery I need some days off. Actually, I hit for the first time little bit on Saturday very easily. I had my first round on Monday. So now I'm very pleased with my decision over there.",You said something about it being harder for girls to keep up this success. Why do you think that is?,"I don't know. I think a lot of people are talking about us. Like when you are watching men's, for example, there is break of serve it's nothing really special. But in our game it is. No, but I'm just really kidding little bit (smiling).","I remember your coach saying a long time ago he tried to get you out of tennis sometimes, to cinemas, to art galleries. Does he still do that? Is tennis slightly less important for you than other players?",Really? He does it?,Yes,Yes, 
69,9055,33080,Did the conditions have any affect on your serve?,"It wasn't too bad out there, I didn't think. I know it's pretty windy outside, but I think it was a little bit protected in there today. It was breezy, but I didn't find it too bad at all.",What do you take out of this result?,"Yeah, I mean, top 10 players are always tough to play against. Obviously very happy with the first round. I played extremely well in tough conditions. To win in straight sets over a best-of-five sets, it's not easy to do. Very happy with that. Good to be in the winner's circle again here at the Aussie Open. I mean, second round's obviously disappointing. Would have been nice to win at least a couple more matches. I'll try to continue my year and get back in the top 100 as soon as I can.",You came in on second serves a lot. Is there no other way to go? Because you don't compete with a guy like that at the back court. Is that how you see it?,I can play from the back. I can play from the net. I choose to come in. That's the way I want to play.,Where does this leave you in terms of your career? Are you confident to move forward and beat one of these top 10 players in the next month or year or so?,"I've beaten top 10 players before. I beat Berdych in straight sets last week. Obviously I can beat top 10 players. It just depends on how I play on the day. Today he played a little bit too good. I wasn't up to scratch. I think for sure I'm improving. I'm only 23, so I have a lot of tennis ahead of me.","Is consistency the key of staying in the top 100, maybe the top 50?","Yeah, I mean, if I can play my best tennis all the time, I can be top 50 comfortably.",UNK,No, 
117,6365,23353,Can you just talk about how hard it is to hit a winner against him?,Asking me a lot of questions about him.,"Well, it's a big match. When you're hitting a ball against him, I would think it's not like playing a normal guy trying to hit a winner, no?","I'm telling you, if I'm going to hit a winner it's gonna be a winner. Doesn't matter if it's gonna be Nadal or whoever. I'm going to go for my shots, and I want to see that of course it's maybe is going to take me more than one shot. Maybe it's going to take me two shots. But I'm going to be ready for it. One shot one corner, one shot other corner. I want to see him get it.",You have had a lot of success on a bunch of different surfaces. Do you feel any one of them is harder on your body than another?,"Hard court, for sure, is the hardest one, because of because it's hard court it's like running on, I don't know, asphalt where the cars go. It's really hard for your knees. But I feel good, you know. I'm not really tired. I feel nothing is really in pain. I'm surprised. I'm surprised that my body reacts really well to a lot of matches.",Have you had injury problems before when you had a lot of matches?,When I had a lot of matches. (Smiling.),"Have you woken up any time in the last couple of days and said to yourself, I can't believe I'm winning this many matches in a row?","No, no, I am pretty realistic guy. I wake up and I have a good sense of reality.",Yes,Yes, 
2,734,2682,"You spoke to the physical aspect of not being dead tired, better than the alternative.  A Slam usually builds emotionally as well with each round.  You haven't gotten into an emotional rhythm.",An emotional rhythm?  You sound like my therapist.,That was my other career goal.,Congrats.,"Can you speak to that?  You said you haven't been tested.  Now you're going to face the ultimate test maybe.  Is that a problem, that you haven't had that mental time to prepare?","I don't know.  Like I said, you could probably spin it either way you wanted to.  You could say I could be fresh mentally or maybe I haven't been freaking out enough over the past two weeks.  I don't know. You guys can run with that any way you want.  It's kind of out of my hands.  I'm going to kind of focus on the task at hand.",Does strategy matter against Roger or do you pretty much have to be perfect or almost perfect?,"No, I think strategy matters.  You know, but you have to have your strategy and then you have to be able to execute it.",Is there a difference playing him in the quarters and playing him in the final?  Is there any benefit at all to get him in the quarters?,I don't know.  I've never played him in the quarters.,UNK,UNK, 
104,846,3110,"Actually, for one game you should have the break point. At that point audience said, Maria, I love you, so would that influence you at that moment?","No, not really.","After you got French Open title, you got the Grand Slam, so I want to understand what might be your next goal.","Well, I have a lot of goals. I don't usually like to talk about my goals. I just like to work for them, and when I achieve them, then I like to talk about them, that it's a goal that I really wanted to achieve and accomplish. But the reason I play this sport is because I believe that I could be better, that I could win more Grand Slams. I'm still very young, I have the passion and energy for it. That's what keeps me going. I have a lot of things in my life that tennis has brought me, but I still feel like there is a lot more that I can accomplish in the sport.","I think in the WTA ranking, actually a lot of young juniors is catching up. Do you feel a lot of pressure from those junior players? How are you going to still keep very good fitness faced with those pressures?","Well, I have been on the tour for many years. I started as a young teenager, and I'm 25 years old now. I feel like I have seen a lot of different generations. The reality of it is it's not like your generation is going to be the only one playing tennis. You're always going to see new upandcomers and talent, you know, great players that are juniors and that are making the transition from the juniors to the pros, you know, and it's part of it. When you retire, there's always going to be somebody that takes your place in the rankings and the draws. That's just the reality of it. I feel like I'm somewhere in the middle. When I came up, you know, you had Justine and Kim and the Williamses, and I felt I was kind of the younger of the bunch. Now I'm somewhere in the middle. You see a couple of retirements, some are still playing, and then you see a younger generation. I'm really kind of smack in the middle.","There was a point in the first set where you dropped a few games and you called your coach over. After that you were able to come back and win the first set. What did your coach say to you, and how did you get the mental toughness to overcome that and win the set?","I think in moments like that, you know, especially in situations when you find yourself up and then losing a few games, it's more of a motivation thing and just for him to come out and give you a little bit of positive words and motivation and energy. Really, it's not like they're going to say something that's going to change things around so much, because when you're in the third set and it's 5All, 6All, you know, you're not really going to pay attention to anything around you. You really go out and play with instinct. In a moment like that, he just said to keep going for it. You lost your concentration a little bit. You started the match really well. There's no reason why you can't get that momentum back.", , ,UNK,UNK, 
76,19184,69710,"On looking on FaceBook, I see that you're a member of the Fans of Casey Dellacqua Group.  The change in recognition you've now got, what does that mean to you?","Yeah, I guess -- it's so funny, because, yeah, as I've said, I've played at such a different level.  I've had like probably five people come out and watch me, which is usually my family.  Now I'm having 15,000 people the whole nation, the whole of Perth and everyone behind me. I love it.  It's great.  I thank everyone for all the support.  I've had so many text messages that I haven't been able to reply to, so many FaceBook messages that I haven't been able to reply to.  Hopefully over the next couple days, I'll be able to thank everyone. Yeah, I even went to get a sandwich for lunch today.  A few people came running up to me.  It's different for me, really different.  I've really enjoyed it.  It's great.  I really just, yeah, thank everyone for the support.","As a confirmed fan, are you pretty proud of yourself this week?","Yeah, I think so.  Definitely.  I think I've come a long way.  I've worked really, really hard, starting even from the Gold Coast up there, then last week in Hobart. Then I've really pushed through this week.  Yeah, obviously won some really close matches.  And mentally I think I've made a lot of gains.  Now my belief is up there and I know that I can compete with these type of girls. Yeah, as I said, I'm not going to be complacent and I'm going to continue to work harder and harder because it hasn't finished for me.  Obviously, my career, I feel, like is just starting.  So, yeah, I'm pretty happy with the week.",You seem in pretty good spirits despite the loss.  Does the enormity of this week outweigh the disappointment of losing tonight?,"No, I am disappointed.  I wouldn't say that I'm not, especially how I let the second set slip away, I guess, in a way. But I've got to take the positives out of every match.  I've got to take the mental gains that I've made, the physical, the match play, everything.  I've got to try to take out the positives. Yeah, obviously disappointed, but I guess move forward and next week I'm going to be playing Fed Cup for Australia, so I have no time to feel sorry for myself.  Got to get back on the court and keep working at it.  Yeah, hopefully Australia, we can have a good week next week in Thailand.",Do you know what comes after Fed Cup?,"There's a tournament in Pattaya, WTA.  I'm going to play there.  Then I'll maybe head back to Perth, have a little time to settle down before I head overseas, head to the States, then be away for most of the year, I would think, yeah.",What will you take from this tournament that you think you'll most treasure?,"I think the Mauresmo match was pretty special for me.  Yeah, I think it's just the whole feeling of the whole nation getting behind you.  It's an amazing feeling for me, for someone that's never been at a tournament and had so much support. I won't forget the feeling like being out on Rod Laver Arena.  I'm certainly going to remember that and want to be out there again, that's for sure.",No,No, 
116,10917,39815,Were you surprised by how well she served in the clutch when it was important?,"She served well, but, you know, I felt like, you know, I always had to be alert, because she could -- you know, she would serve some double faults and then she would come out with some really good serves. And then, you know, sometimes she would toss it way, you know, out of -- and then she would hit it, and you don't know where it's gonna go. So it was kind of tough. But she did real well, you know. She served, you know, more good serves than she did bad ones. So, you know I had a lot of opportunities, you know, to return and break, and I just didn't do it. I don't even know how many break points I had, and just converted one. So I let the opportunity slip away.","It's hard sometimes when she's playing that well to keep the ball away from her forehand, huh, when she gets into the good forehand rhythm?","You know, like I said, I had a lot of chances, and I felt really flat. Like my feet, you know, were not moving. A lot of times I felt like stuck on my shots and I didn't really move up, you know, to the balls as well as I was doing in the previous matches. So, you know, I didn't do those right, and she was really on top of her game. So that was the difference, you know. She really, you know, was hitting the ball cleanly and was really solid out there, so she was a better player today.",Is it distracting when she's catching her toss as much as she does?,"You know, it's not really distracting, you know. Just sometimes she hits it, you know, when she toss it bad, and sometimes she, you know, catches it and serves again. So you always have to be ready, because you don't know, you know. But, you know, it's the way she does it. You know, there's nothing I can do about that. It's her thing.",Is this the best you've seen her play in a long time?,"To be honest, I haven't really watched her play much. But, you know, from what she played today, you know, she played such a great match today. So she was really, you know, on her game, and she really didn't make a lot of unforced errors. She really, you know, hit the ball pretty clean, pretty solid. So probably. You know, I cannot really say. You can ask her that better, but she played really well.",You had a bandage on the back of your leg. Was that any kind of a problem?,"No, you know, it's for prevention. But I have been having like some ankle things, and, you know, in my knee since -- because I fell down in Doha, so sometimes I have pains here and there. But it wasn't bothering me today. Just, you know, that had nothing to do with my play. I just didn't move really -- you know, I felt kind of stuck on my feet and didn't really play my tennis, didn't really do what I was supposed to do. Probably, you know, one of the worst, you know, tennis, you know, matches I've played since this -- you know, since I started playing, you know, these couple of tournaments, which I have made pretty good results.",No,No, 
148,730,2675,"Is it a positive or a negative to be so fresh?  You want to be fresh, but do you want to be this fresh?","I don't know.  I don't know if it does too much good to worry about it because it's out of my hands.  I know that this is a lot better than being dead tired.  Given the two options, I'll take this one.",What did he say to you at the net?,"Nothing.  I just asked him what was wrong.  He said, you know -- said he was just tired and couldn't really do much.  I just told him I hope he got better.",Do you feel like you've been tested?  At what points during this tournament do you feel you've been tested?  By Johansson?,"I haven't been tested much this tournament so far.  I was on the ropes a little bit against Gimel.  Acasuso played a good first set.  I haven't really played a long, extended match.","Will you watch Federer's match tonight?  If so, at this point, do you ever learn anything from watching him on TV?","I'm not sure.  I mean, I think we played each other enough, you kind of know.  I don't think I'm going to watch him and discover that he's good tonight, you know. But, yeah, I don't know.  I'm not sure.",Will you be rooting one way or another?,"No offense to Lpez, but I'm kind of already preparing for Roger.",No,Yes, 
152,14446,52459, , ,Were you aware that he was injured before the match?,"I just heard that he had some struggles with his stomach muscle. But, you know, I wasn't sure how serious it is. You know, I didn't know that he's not able to serve. After the match he told me that he could not make a full movement of the serve that he usually does. I could see that, because he serves well over 200, you know, first serving average, and he couldn't do that today. He obviously tried his best. It's the third round of a Grand Slam. It's not the way you want to finish the tournament, definitely. You know, it's sad for him. But I have to move on.",Did you need to have a complete game today or are you happy with the one set?,"You know, I think I had enough tennis already the last couple weeks. It's good that, you know, you don't spend that much time on the court, maybe save some energy. But I'm going to be ready for next match.",You're moving quietly through the tournament. Is this suiting you? Not many people talking about you.,"Yeah, I like it this way. I'm there to do my job. Obviously, the matches are starting to be more difficult. You will have higher-ranked opponents and I'm ready for that challenge.",Can you tell how tough it is for a player to come from the junior level to this circuit like you did and some other players did?,"We don't notice that many young players in the top 50, top 100 in the last two, three years, which is sad for the sport. But maybe it's just a period. I'm sure that we'll see some new faces coming up in the near future. But it's definitely very difficult to make the transition from junior tour and circuit to the professional because you have to go through this ice-breaker, as you can call it, the futures, the satellites and challengers, the lower level of the professional tournaments where you don't get to play in very nice places, you don't have the best conditions. But you have to go through it. It makes you much stronger. This is where I guess you're building up your mentality, as well. You're becoming stronger mentally. You know, if you're able to get through that stage, then just break through in top hundred. I think nowadays it's more difficult than it was maybe five, ten years ago.",No,UNK, 
96,5241,19284,Then nine match points with Gasquet. Today again. You just don't think or what happens?,"Yeah, definitely I'm scared. Like I just go through my routine and I just play aggressive. You know, if they play too good on that point, then it's too good. But I'm going to go after it and give myself the best chance to win the point.","The other day you said that between you and Rafa, you have won an incredible 14 Grand Slams. People were thinking by the end of Wimbledon it would be 15. What do you think of that?","You know, I've got another chance to go out there tomorrow and get through another round, but I'm not thinking about any of that stuff yet. It was just a comment for a bit of a laugh. It's gone pretty much viral. Yeah.","You can probably tell that the buzz is building at home from looking at Twitter and online. Do you feel any pressure with the weight of a nation, Australia, behind you now?","You know, I think I've achieved a lot this week. It's definitely been the best week of my life. It's great, you know, they've given me so much support. You know, I don't think there's any pressure at all. You know, I'm not feeling any pressure. I'm just feeling motivation to keep going and give my absolute all out there. No matter what happens, I'll be happy.",How hard do you think the recovery will be with a match again tomorrow?,"Yeah, it's going to be a tough ask, but I'm going to do everything possible and see how my body responds tomorrow. If I come up short, I come up short. I'm going to give it my best shot, and whatever happens, happens.",Rafael Nadal said earlier that you play very good on the grass and he hasn't seen you on any other surfaces. He's not sure how good you are on other surfaces. What's your answer to that?,"I think in the near future he'll probably see me more on other surfaces. I'd like to think I'm comfortable on clay as well. I played some really good matches on clay. I played  I qualified at the US Open last year, lost to Ferrer, so I think I'm competitive on other surfaces as well. We'll see. Next time I play him on clay, we'll see how it goes.",No,No, 
170,14363,52185,"Was there a low point where you ever actually considered, I don't know that I'll ever be back? Did you ever think about another career option, or did you always know that you were going to make it back?","Um, I never looked at any options, as tennis is what I've known since I was four years old. It's what I've done every single morning since then. There is no -- obviously it's tough, because I think the toughest was when I first just tried to rehab for three months thinking that was going to do something, but then it didn't and I had to have my first surgery. Then when you're 21 and having to make that decision, it also is in the back of my mind that not people have come back from shoulder surgery at all. So that was a tough thought to process. But I couldn't -- I mean, I really couldn't hit a serve and I couldn't hit a backhand volley, anything that was high. It was just -- I mean, I had to do something, so that was kind of the plan B.","What can you do to play a series of matches like this, which means you end up holding a trophy at the end of the week?",Right.,Do you have a feeling for what you need to do differently or what else you need to do in order to be able to get that consistency?,"Well, a lot of it is adjustments throughout the match, and depending on your opponents. You know, if you find yourself with a game plan that's just you come out and you're not feeling it or it doesn't quite work, you just really have to find a way to adjust to your opponent and maybe the conditions sometimes and just really figure it out. That's the great thing about the sport is that, you know, you have so many points and so many games, and many, many different situation opportunities. Just really got to take care of them.",Your website is linked with Kei Nishikori's at the moment about the Japan charity. Can you talk about that a little bit or how you became involved or wanted to?,"Yeah. Well, it's obviously a huge tragedy around the world right now. Japan just is one of my favorite countries to visit. First time I went there I think was 13 or 14 years old playing a junior tournament, one of the outside cities. I've just had such memorable times there. To see the country struggle so much as it is now, I think everyone is trying to do as much as we can. Kei and I are trying to set something up for the tournament later in the year to help raise as much money as we can. Yeah, I just hope that, you know, with the radiation, that gets taken care of as soon as possible so it doesn't spread and cause it to last really long.","You had complimented Samantha on her serve, but your return of serve today seemed to be very, very spot-on. Could you talk about that a little bit?","Well, against a good server, that's sometimes even more important than your own serve because it puts a little bit of, you know, thought process into their mind when they step onto the line, you know. I was quite solid, and in the beginning I thought I made a few more errors on the second serves than I should have. You know, I adjusted to that and I became more solid and started going for it a little bit more and I felt more comfortable.",Yes,Yes, 
266,2667,9631,How did you feel coming into the match?  Were you at all anxious going in?,"I was a bit anxious.  Physically, I was really concerned about my knee for a few days.  So I was a bit anxious, because I knew I wasn't really 100 percent.  Even if it's not an excuse about what happened on the court, because she was much better than me. I knew she was in top form and I knew it was going to be tough, so I was ready to fight and give my best, but it wasn't good enough.",Do you know what's wrong with your knee?,"Well, it's -- it's old problem.  It's just my knee is getting old, and, yeah, probably have to rest a little bit now.","Has her game gotten a lot more varied in the last year or so, would you say?","She worked hard, I think, in the off-season.  Apparently her shoulder is good now, so it gives her a lot of self-confidence.  She serves great.  She did everything well today.  She was playing the lines.  She was really aggressive.  She was attacking the ball, and I was way too far. She, I think, improved quite a lot in the last few weeks and came back much better than she was last year.",Do you think she'll win it from here?,"I think so, but a lot of things can happen.  She looks like she's the player who is really confident now, and she has a great chance to do it, I think.", , ,Yes,Yes, 
183,3770,13720,"Can you talk about the adrenaline rush you still get from playing out on a major court in a Grand Slam, especially at home.","Yeah, it's fantastic. You would have seen a lot of the crowd really lifted towards the end of the fourth set there when I started to get back into that set and they could sense that he was getting a little bit tight trying to close it out and going to a fifth as well. Yeah, feelings like that you can't buy. Until you're one of the players out there experiencing it, it is a massive adrenaline rush.",What about the match coming up against Andy Roddick? Must be looking forward to that one.,"Yeah, I haven't even thought about it yet. Yeah, obviously when the draw came out, I knew that Andy was a possibility. But, you know, I haven't played that much matches, so all my focus was on this guy. I knew absolutely nothing about him really going into tonight. Obviously it's not quite the case with Andy now. Don't really have to ask around too much to find out what Andy's strengths and weaknesses are.",Are you confident you are able to beat Andy?,I'll give him a good run. See what happens.,"Do you feel that you benefited from some of his inexperience? He never challenged when you broke in the 11th game of the first set. On the TV screen, the ball was in.","I don't know. He challenged a lot, as well, got 'em wrong. You know, I don't know. You don't just challenge all the time for the sake of it. Obviously off his racquet, he felt it was wide, as well. I mean, I don't know.",You've been playing Andy Roddick for over a decade now. Talk about how his game has evolved over the years.,"His strengths are still pretty much the same. Obviously his serve's his biggest strength. For a big guy he moves well. From the back of the court his forehand is probably stronger than his backhand. Yeah, he's obviously capable of coming to the net, too. He's an allcourt player. He's probably added to his net game a little bit more since the first time I played him, whatever, when he was a 19, 20yearold, whatever it was. He's a complete player.",UNK,UNK, 
227,12282,44729,What was the most desperate measure you've ever taken to lose weight?,"The most desperate measure (laughter)? There's a nutritionist I work with down at Bollettieri's, and it's always an experiment. We're always trying to do the balancing act. The bottom line is, if you cut out too many calories, you can't work out. You need to get fitter by working out, and you need to improve my game by working out. So if I'm eating a thousand calories a day, who cares? My forehand's going to suck, my serve is going to suck, so who cares? But the most desperate measure, I said any carb I get is going to be from a vegetable. I lasted three days. I was like this on the court. I couldn't do anything. I walked into the lady, and she said, What are you doing? I said, I'm not having any carbs. I'm trying to do it through broccoli. She just started laughing. She's like, There's no energy in those things.",You have Soderling next. What is your head-to-head?,"Head-to-head? The way he beat me at the French could have counted for two, but I think he's got one on me. I think that's all we've played. But I don't know. I'm horrible at that stuff.","When you're going against Soderling, you really made some advances. What is your thought about him? Do you scout him? Do you do anything? Do you just do your thing?","My thought about him is he's a great player. He's solid. There's not really a lot of holes in his game right now. There used to be the errant ball two or three times in the back fence. That doesn't happen anymore. He's solid. It's something I always tell Jenny and my dad when we're talking about scouting guys. The reality of the matter is I'm not good enough to worry about the other guy. That's the reality of the matter. I don't feel like I'm reliable enough in my game to sacrifice just thinking about my execution out there, what I have to do to play and impose my game. I'm fortunate, because if I do execute my game, there's not a whole lot guys can do in the first place. But, you know, as soon as I get better, more reliable out on the court to where I feel very confident with what I'm doing and how I'm doing it, then I'll start to maybe pick apart guy's games. To be honest, I'm just not at that level right now.", , , , ,UNK,UNK, 
118,15984,58040,It's going to stay blue and white stripes for the moment for here?,"Yeah. That was their main line, what they want to have here in Australia. I do have two more outfits which is going to go till MonteCarlo. Then, yeah, there is going to be some other nice changes through the year, so...",What about for Wimbledon?,"Yeah, they are very sad. Especially, you know, when you tell to the fashion brand that they have to make white, they are like, Oh, okay, what can we do? It's just for hopefully two weeks. Then they can go again.",Do you enjoy being the one guy from H& M instead of five like Nike guys in the top 10?,"Definitely I do. It's something very unique, very special, especially in this kind of brand, as I said, which is not a mainsport brand. It's something else. It's a fashion company. You know, they choose me to be the only one. Really it's a huge, huge national, worldwide brand. So, yeah, it feels very special to me.","What did you think when you looked at the draw, your half of the draw?","Honestly I haven't seen the draw. I just go one by one. I heard that I might play the winner of Anderson and RogerVasselin. That's all I know for the future. Even if I see more, it's not important at all to me because really, I mean, especially here in the first week the opponents was not the only one who you need to fight with. It was the conditions: the heat, the wind, everything. I'm really happy that I kind of survive it, especially today. I'm really looking forward for some cooler conditions.","When you see Roger and Rafa and Andy and Tsonga are not playing the same day as you, you have an idea.","Of course I do. Of course I do. You doesn't have to be smart to figure it out that they not going to be in your half. You know, it's always about the draw. Really, if I'm going to have it once pretty good, yes, I take it. Always the next few times it's going to be the opposite way or other way around, whatever it is. Really, I just want to take it how it is, be prepared for every single match, no matter who is there, who is waiting for me.",Yes,Yes, 
74,8538,31095,"Is there one issue, Andy, that you would like that person really to tackle when he or she comes in?","When she comes in, I think -- you know, we've been talking about schedule length for a long time with not a lot of success, you know. There's been, okay, new schedule, new schedule, and we're all supposed to celebrate but it all ends kind of at the same time, and we have to travel to another part of the world and back. I think that's something that needs to be addressed. Not only from a player's perspective as far as injuries. That's probably the main concern. But even giving the fans a chance to miss the game, you know. You're seeing, you know, these NFL shows, these preseason things have been going on for two months now. I think you need a little bit of buildup, maybe a little bit of time to miss it. I think that's something that never really gets talked about. Because you guys get to go to great, fun places, like Basel in the fall.","You've been on both sides of fan support. I mean, J Block had a warning last night in the match. Do you think that someone's fans can go too far in a situation like that?","I mean -- I'm probably on the extremely liberal side of fans and sports, and as far as like being on the court, you know. If I complain about anybody carrying on during a match, I'd be bordering on hypocracy. You know, it's sports. You're supposed to go after someone. There's supposed to be tense moments, you're supposed to yell, you're supposed to scream. All of a sudden if there's a net and racquets involved, you can't do that. As long as it's -- if someone tosses a ball up and you yell, then I think that's a direct distraction. If it's between points, yeah, they can do whatever they want. I think as long as you're respectful of the rules of the game, have a ball. Do what you got to do. It only adds to the atmosphere.",So the umpire was out of line?,"I don't know the specific thing you're talking about. If you're talking about yelling during a point. I hear people saying, why do you have to be quiet? We use all of our senses. If someone slices, if someone really cracks the ball, that's programmed into our minds. So I think that's important. People moving and whatnot, we're trying to see a ball moving at a hundred and whatever miles an hour. As long as it's in the framework of being respectful, then I'm all for it. You can do a handstand if you want.","Did you watch the match last night, and if so, was it very difficult between close friends?","Yeah, it was weird. And it was -- and it wasn't enjoyable for me to watch. I was thrilled for Mardy for the way he played and I felt just as bad for James, you know, that he had to leave this tournament. It was just weird afterwards. I was talking with my fiance afterwards and she said, you seem a little off right now. And it was weird, because there was like I'm so happy for Mardy to do well. But you get the shot of James walking off, and -- it was weird. You know, it's not something that I like to watch every day.","Do you think the code of conduct is a bit too much, bit too strong, so if a guy cracks his racquet down the court, so what, there's no harm?","I don't -- I mean, show me a fan that doesn't listen. You watched, you know, McEnroe for years, if you loved him or hated him, you watched him. You know, you break a racquet. If a guy wants to break a bat in the dugout, he doesn't get warned. It's not hurting anyone. If it's affecting your opponent, then that's probably disrespectful, then keep it out of there, but my racquet. Not anybody else's. (laughter.) I wouldn't break your stuff.",UNK,UNK, 
229,8864,32280,"Are you confident that everything will be ready on time for your tournament? I saw some pictures, and...","No, no, no, don't worry. Everything will be on time. They are working on it since the start of this year. I mean, already two months working, and we gonna make a good impression.","Talk Viktor Troiki, your countryman. We don't know much about him.","Yeah, he's playing fantastic in the last two events. He's a physically very strong guy. He's always been like that, even in juniors. He had a little issues with the groundstrokes, with the technique, but now he is improved. His forehand is much better, and his movement has always been very powerful for his height. So we can expect him to do well in the future.",Have you helped him or mentored him in any way?,He's older. He knows., , , , ,No,No, 
29,7007,25584,Talk about that a little bit.,"It was just, you know, it's a group decision because obviously I was struggling with the shoulder for quite a while.  After Wimbledon, you know, all of us, my team got together and we just thought of all the things that could help my shoulder not just for the next tournament or not just for the next Grand Slam but for my future, what was going to be important for it. You know, I adjusted my weight of my racquet a little bit.  I changed the serve and made it a little shorter.  It's not that short, just shorter than it used to be because my old swing used to be pretty dramatically long.",How do you think it's affected action of your serve itself?,"It's interesting because you know, changes take quite a long time to figure out whether it's, I don't know, a new string or a new racquet or a new motion.  I've never really had to change too much over the course of the last couple of years, you know, until I've had to change the swing on my serve.  So you know, but that's just so I can play for so many years and not be injured. And you know, as an athlete you have to be pretty realistic about those things because you want to be healthy as much as possible.  So you understand those circumstances even though you -- because you personally don't like changes.  I don't want to -- I'm pretty stubborn.  I like to keep things the same.  Once your injured and you realize you can't play then you try it find things that will make that better.",Are you losing power as a result?,"I don't think so.  I mean, I serve pretty consistently today.  I hit one 115 or 116 actually.  But I feel like my speed is getting here.  In the middle of year I was just trying to get a higher percentage of first serves in and now I'm feeling like I'm getting a lot more velocity in it.","It's not even that you serve and volley.  You did that a couple times tonight.  Coming into the tournaments that what, you were saying you could do that once in a while as a change-up?","Well, my serve becomes better when I jump forward and I move in.  It just gives me more confidence on the serve.  It's a good way to practice it when you're up 30-Love or 40-Love.  I mean, why not?  I mean, like I said, I'm going to be playing for a few years to come. If I can add these things to my game now it'll only make me a better player in the coming years.",What would you give yourself grade-wise tonight?,"I think I did everything solid.  She's a pretty quick opponent, like she'd rush from side to side.  Like I said, a couple years ago those types of opponents would have been difficult on me.  But I feel like I'm a much more patient player now and I feel like I can handle that and not have that many problems with it.",No,No, 
246,10783,39254,Any difference for you between singles and doubles for the Olympics?,"No, not at all.",Gold is gold?,"If I had to choose, for sure I don't want to say this but definitely doubles. To win with Serena at the Olympics is an unparalleled feeling.",Have you ever thought about the winter Olympics? Maybe you could bobsled or something. (Smiling).,I don't know if my sprinting is up to par to be able to bobsled.,"It would have to be a big sled, too.",Everybody be going left and I'd be going right. They'd beat me up afterwards. Winter Olympics is not for me. I don't like cold.,None of those sports are for you?,"I don't have the talent, so I will stick to tennis.",UNK,No, 
219,9479,34543,You obviously have had a very good season. Is there anything you've taken from this week that you can put into your offseason for 2014?,"Yeah, of course. I'm taking a lot of experience playing this Masters because the level is very high, very difficult. So, of course, it's very good for me to play these match for next year. I think I'm taking a lot of information for 2014, and I will try to do better. These guys are tough, are very great players, the best in the world. So I need to improve on my game to play these guys.",Do you notice anything different playing Federer now than in previous seasons?,"Yeah, I think it's a great court for him. To play him indoors is very difficult for my game. He's playing fast, especially with the forehand. Yeah, he's still a very good player. He's still able to win the tournament, yeah.","One of the features of the tournament is you get wellknown sports people here, Olivier Giroud and Laurent Koscielny. Do you get to know these sports people throughout your career?",They are friend of mine. It was very nice for them to come here. I saw them on the corner. It was nice they support me. I thank them for coming. I appreciate it.,"Richard, usually French players are here. Tsonga got to a final. Do you think they appreciate the work you are doing? Roger today said if you don't get to the finals, you are not mentioned. Do you think the work of the French players is appreciated all around?","Appreciated? I don't know. We're trying our best, of course. We are not Federer, Nadal. No French won a Grand Slam. But we are just trying the best we can. Everybody can't be No.1. So, as I said, we are just trying our best to improve our game, to be better tennis player. That's why we are playing tennis to improve and to try to win that guys.",Can you tell us about the men's game in France at the moment.,"Yeah, we are a lot of great players in France. Of course, we are two in the top 10, a lot in the top 20. We are a great team next year for the Davis Cup. We are a lot of consistent players. We are happy with the way France is playing in tennis.",Yes,Yes, 
248,9654,35141, , , , ,Are you satisfied with the way you played today?,"It wasn't the best match I played. But it was a tough one. You know, she played a match before. So for me it was the first match since Wimbledon. So, you know, in the beginning obviously struggled to find my rhythm a little bit. But, you know, I'm very happy I managed to win this match. It's never easy. But, you know, you have to win even if you don't play your best tennis. That was the case for me today.",What's the situation with your right hand?,"A couple of days, weeks ago, I aggravated it a little bit practicing. It was a little bit tough and I struggled. I couldn't practice as much as I wanted coming into the tournament, and obviously that was very frustrating. But, you know, I went on the court and that means that I felt a hundred percent ready to play. So, you know, obviously it takes some time to get in a rhythm. But I went through this match today. Probably it would be the same even if I was, you know, feeling a hundred percent. So, yeah, just happy to be here and to have opportunity to play. Obviously tape is something, you know, that prevents and helps inflammation a little bit.",Is it just the thumb?,"The thumb. Just a little bit inflamated [sic]. I did MRI and everything. It wasn't showing anything major, huge, so I was very pleased about that. Just inflammation that takes time to go away.",UNK,No, 
179,6221,22925,At the end of the match you pointed to your box. How important is having your coaches during the last few weeks?,"Well, support is something that is always welcome, especially in the big events like this. My coaches and all the people that are there, my girlfriend, my uncle, family members, friends, you know, they all have been with me throughout the US Open and throughout the all of my life. So this is something that has been created throughout the years, these relations, this relationship I have with Marian. We've been working for four years already, and now starting to work with Todd Martin, as well. So I always try to have a bunch of people around me, because then I feel better, and I can get as much opinions and as much thoughts as I can in order to progress.","With the boos that you heard here last year after the Roddick match and all that, have you made an effort this year to get the crowd on your side? Are you trying to work with them, like the McEnroe thing the other night, just trying to get them behind you this year?","Well, I obviously -- obviously the crowd is very important and plays a crucial role in big matches. What happened last year I was saying many times this year already in the conferences was misunderstanding, and obviously something that we all learn from. I learned from my mistakes. I mean, it's all right, as long as I realize the things that happen and try to take the best out of it, and then, you know, try to gain back the crowd. I hope that's what I did, because I feel that I'm enjoying it again much more. It feels like 2007, you know, when I played finals here and did all these crazy things, impersonating the players. So it was really a lot of enjoyment playing with McEnroe the other night. It was something else. You know, it was unexpected. I promise it wasn't planned. It just came out. It was good.","When you get deep into a Slam, how do you find that balance between the work you do between the matches? Who makes that call? Is it you? Is it Marian? Who makes the call about the amount of time you do spend preparing?","Well, depending on the matches that I play and depending how my body feels, then we make a plan together. You know, they're the bosses. I have to follow what they say, you know. That's why they're there. They're coaches. It's their job to try to improve my game and make me feel good, and obviously all it's compromise. Now we have an extra day to the semifinals. I think we're going to play golf. Todd is a great golfer. Generally we will practice a little bit, not too much.","My name is Angela Buxton, and I've written a book called 303 Tips For Successful Tennis Players, together with a Serbian tennis coach called Nesa Simic, who I believe you might know.",Yes.,"It is due for publication, which includes Serbia as well as worldwide early next year. As the leading Serbian tennis player, I would be very grateful if you could say something encouraging to young Serbian players and worldwide that would encourage them that could be used in the book.","Wow. I should carefully choose my next words obviously in the book. If you want, we can do it later one on one? Better? I can dedicate my time to you more. You want me to do it now and embarrass myself?",UNK,UNK, 
132,14183,51614,"Was it a bit weird on the court against Stan, who was missing a lot?","I like to believe I was the cause of him missing that many balls. I got on top of the match pretty early. I broke him in the first game of the first set. I had a good momentum to sort of feed off, then in the same time I was playing a good tennis. In a way I just felt that I'm doing a good job. The only thing I could do is play my game, just having less mistakes. I think all that in a way paid off in a good way for me.",Is this week the best tennis you've played since a while?,"I would say yes and no. If you look at it from the tennis point of view, yeah, maybe. As a performance, even though I haven't played that many matches this year, the beginning of the year I had a good start. I don't think of it that way because I'm focused on each tournament and what's my goal. I think this is pretty much the most important part for me at the moment, to look after my matches.","I saw you playing very well yesterday against Fognini and today even better, or is it just two different opponents with different games?","First, it's two different opponents. Second is that I think I was just very consistent. I had a good level yesterday. I felt that early on today I had a good level, too. For me, I didn't have to do anything else in a way. I didn't have to improvise much. All I had to do is play a solid game. I think that was pretty much it for me. Everything else was just coming and I was playing good, game after game, starting to feel a bit more confident. Again, I didn't think Stan played his best tennis, that's true. Everyone saw that. But winning is winning.","It's a long time since you haven't beaten a top 30 player, since Toronto last year. Is it a new click or new start?","Depends what kind of click you're talking about. No, I haven't felt I've been lacking to beat higherranked players in a way. If you think about it, the competition nowadays is so tough and so big, you can't really think like that. I mean, if you see a guy that is, let's say, ranked 40, you can easily lose to him if you're not there, if you're not playing a good tennis. There's just so many components that are out in the game, if you allow yourself to think that way, I think you're going to lose every day.","Looking at your earlier successes, I would say that your grass court game is your greatest strength, then hard court. You seem to be improving all the time on the clay. Would you agree with that? Which surface do you enjoy playing on mostly?","I always felt I'm playing pretty much good on any surface. Of course, grass is my preferable. Of course, I like hard court. But I grew up on clay. My early years, I mean, they were pretty much on clay. Yeah, so, I mean, I feel quite comfortable. In the same time I had quite a bit of time after Miami to come back here and start practicing. I think that was one of my best preparations I had. I felt that I've done everything in a good and a positive way. The results are here for now.",Yes,Yes, 
159,2739,9977,You're taking hip hop lessons?,"Yeah.  My fitness coach gives hip hop lessons.  We just started.  Just for fun sometimes we do it.  It's just my relaxing time in preparation.  An hour a week we do some hip hop.  I'm so bad, but I want to improve, so that's good.",Are we going to see you bust out some dance moves after a match?,Never.  Don't dream (laughter).,Is a winning streak anything that's in the front of your head?,"It's a kind of pressure because everyone -- I mean, one day or another I will lose.  I mean, that's the game.  I hope it's going to be as late as possible. But, no, what I'm doing for -- I wouldn't say for a couple months, but the last year is just great.  I've been so consistent.  But every match is different.  You have to start again all the time. You know if you're not in your best level you know you can lose.  Every time I wake up now I know I can win, I know I can lose.  I just want to stay focused on the main important things, because one day or another it will come that I'll have not a very good day.  So we'll see.  I hope it's not going to be for this tournament.",You also used to share the spotlight with Kim in your country until a year ago.  Does it feel different not having her around?,"Well, it was great for Belgium to have two players like us at the same time.  It was almost a perfect story.  Now the attention is a lot on myself, but it was already before. As soon as I arrived at the top and I became the No.1 player in the world, there was a lot of attention in Belgium.  Maybe a little bit more now because it's only me on the woman's side.  But I don't feel extra pressure for that.",Do you see her at all?,"No, no, no.  I just heard she's pregnant, and it's very soon.  Wish her the best.  But we didn't speak for a long time now.",UNK,No, 
185,10456,38089,"How can you hurt her tomorrow? She's a very aggressive player, a lot of power.","I think the backhand side is weaker on the forehand side. I'm lefty, so I will try to open the court with my forehand side and push her out to the backhand. She's a big server, so try to put as much returns as possible and use the rotation, especially to her backhand as well.",You're the kind of player that on any given day it's very difficult to say that you're going to lose because you can beat a lot of top players. You have the game. What do you think you need to do to be more consistent and do it on a more regular basis? Do you feel you're close to doing it?,"Well, it's always you have to be healthy, you have to also have a little bit of luck, and to be able to have constant game. In the past I played some great matches, but then I played also some very bad matches. That's what should not happen for the top players. So that's what I'm working on, to be more constant and be a little bit more patient on the court. I hope I will get there soon.","Can you tell me, the swing in the middleeast, Doha and Dubai, do you enjoy coming here? How significant is it for you, these two tournaments?","Well, it's both of the tournament, Doha and Dubai, are very wellorganized, very luxury, I would say. For the players it's always nice to come here. Yeah, I think both of the tournament are in the very high level with the others. That's always nice for us players to play such events.","Just going back to back Fed Cup, obviously your opponents are Italy, I believe. What do you make of the Italian team? They won backtoback Fed Cups.","Well, I think it's a team that the players also enjoying to play together and having this team spirit, which is very important in Fed Cup. So it's a very tough team, because usually at the Fed Cup they always play their best. But it's our turn now. It's at home. We chose the surface. It was very tough to play them on clay at home. Now it's our turn. Now it's our home and our advantage, and I hope we will use it.","On a hunch, what surface do you reckon you would play on? Hard?","Well, I would assume it will be a hard court because they are best on clay, but I don't want to say anything yet because it's not decided.",Yes,Yes, 
65,3635,13158,But never on the same court?,Never on the same court.,Were you looking forward to it?,"I definitely was. I was very excited. It's not every day you get to go head-to-head against the No.1 player in the world, possibly one of the best to ever play the game. So to be able to have that experience and go out there and, you know, show people what I could do was great.",Tell us something about your background. Did you go to college?,"Florida. I went to Florida for about eight months, University of Florida, then turned pro in 2007.",Were you an All-American?,"No, I left too early.",Will you tell the key difference between Rafael's game and the usual game?,The games of other players?,Yes,Yes,did she quit college?
167,2255,8116,Your movement looked really good. I was wondering whether you'd worked on that at all.,"I'm always working on everything. Some things you work on a little bit more than others. Over a month you've got to train, you can pretty much do everything you want.",You're certain you're getting better? Do you feel you're getting better?,"I think I am. You know, I'm feeling better out there. I'm feeling more confident. Yeah, I mean, only time will tell. But hopefully I can have a good year this year.",A lot of the Australians tend to play on Margaret Court and have been successful there. Wayne Arthurs used to like playing there. Something particular about that court that suits the local players?,"I mean, it's a great crowd out there. Obviously the third biggest court here. You get a good crowd out there. They're always chanting and cheering for you. It's great to have their support out there. I mean, it's quite a nice court to play on.","It's open to the elements, obviously. Days like today make it a bit more difficult.","Yeah, it's a little bit of an advantage. I mean, it still gets pretty windy in Rod Laver and Hisense Arena. It's windy everywhere when it starts blowing.",How do you approach Simon? Do you think you'll have an underdog factor. Is the pressure on him?,"Yeah, I mean, obviously I'm the underdog. He's ranked, I don't know, 6 or 7 in the world. I mean, I'm going to go into the match and be confident out there and try to get off to a good start, hopefully serve well. Serve is going to be important against him, because he's a great returner. I think I'm going to need some free points out there and hopefully I can get onto a few of his service games here and there.",Yes,Yes, 
85,4995,18378,"If you had been clear on the rule, would you have conceded the point?","Yeah, yeah. If I was clear on the rule, yeah. I mean now, I mean, people would say, Yeah, but maybe you knew the rule, you're lying. I'm completely honest. Nothing to hide really. That's what I thought is the rule. Right now that's the way it is. I mean, it might be a turning point, might not. Anyway, the match is over.","Andy knows that you have done this in the past. You did it yesterday for Robredo. The fact that you're friends, I imagine he knows you'll be fair out there. Did he say anything after the match? Did you talk about it at all?","No. I mean, obviously he was disappointed after losing the match. At the net I said, Sorry about that point. But he didn't want to talk about it, obviously. I understand he's, you know, upset. I don't know what to say more. Really, that's what I felt at that point, that that was the rule. Now that I know differently, I'm going to know for the future.",Did you have any concerns with colder weather conditions before the match today? I wonder if that got into your mind before the match.,"Well, look, you know, we all know that the conditions in Miami can get really difficult for the players, humidity, and of course the wind, that it's changing direction constantly. You could see that it affected him and me also on serves, and we made some double faults in crucial points and so forth. It was not easy. You know, just mentally to hang in there, to stay tough and calm, that helped me obviously, you know, to win this match, I think.",Would you definitely prefer the hotter conditions?,Do I prefer the hotter conditions?,Yeah.,"Well, I no. (Laughter.) I prefer cool conditions, no wind, if you really want to know. But I guess we don't have many of those kind of conditions (smiling).",Yes,Yes, 
182,5876,21630,"To that point, do you think your first title will come at a slam?","I don't know. But then you guys would be scratching your head, wouldn't you? You'd be like, Hmmm, there must be something she's not telling us. No, I don't know.",Totally different silly question.,Okay.,How many of those head bands do you have? How many colors? Is it like a mood ring?,"Honestly? The amount of head bands I have, I'd probably say I have about I'd say I have about 250 head bands. Yeah.","Greatly color coordinated, but do you feel it in the morning?",Do I feel it in the morning?,About what to wear and,I have so many. I can wear a blue outfit and have blue; I can wear purple and have pink and the logo might be like matching my outfit. I don't know. It just depends. It just depends. But I have like a lot a lot.,UNK,Yes, 
12,20216,73447,And was it fun?,Yeah. Apparently I liked it a little bit (laughter.),Are you familiar with the story of how Seles started by hitting against the wall?,Yeah. I've heard that story.,Can you tell me a little bit about your high school education and your relationship with high school? Were you home schooled or...,"I started home schooling when I was 13, and I've been home schooled ever since. So for four, almost five years, I'd say.",Do you wish you ever went to high school? Do you miss that experience?,"No, just because if I had gone to high school I wouldn't have been able to do the things I did for my tennis, and ultimately that was my dream. You know, as I said, I never saw myself as being a college player, so, you know.","We have seen many players coached by their fathers, and some of them went through some kind of trouble, some others didn't. How is your relationship, if, let's say one night you want to go out? You have to ask your father and he's also your coach. How does it work?","We don't really have problems like that. You know, I -- if I want to go out, we usually go out as a family somewhere. But if I want to go out with my friends...",Yes,Yes, 
35,3444,12490,Could you give us your take on the overrule from the smash that didn't go long in the end and your reaction to it.,The challenge?,"Give us your take on that, how that affected you.","It was a classic bad mistake by the lines person. Kind of one of those moments you don't want it to happen so you don't have to defend a breakpoint twice. That's at the end what cost me the maybe the match potentially. It happens the whole time. You hope it doesn't happen in the finals against a great player like Andy on a breakpoint. There's not worse than having to fight off two breakpoints when in essence it's only one and you basically won the point because the overhead was just a 'gimme'. It's unfortunate sometimes how they turn out, these calls. They happen. They will continue to happen. It was a bit of frustration obviously in the moment itself because I didn't hear the call at all. I don't know what happened. I had difficulties communicating with the umpire. He wouldn't understand what I was saying. So that just kind of made it more and more difficult.","He's clearly got a very decent record against you in best-of-three matches. In best-of-five, you've come out on top. Is there somewhat of a different mindset, not more capable, but in the ascendancy in Grand Slam matches rather than in best-of-three?","Well, look, he's still going for his first Grand Slam, so that's hard, you know. You also got to give the guy a bit of I don't want to say time, but like credit for trying and playing so well in the Masters 1000s. He's won a bunch of those guys now. Obviously clearly the next step for him is to win a Grand Slam. But it's not easy to break through. You have to break through me, I don't know if he's been in another Grand Slam final other than me. There's tough guys at the top right now and they don't give you just an easy match, you know. But he's capable of beating everybody right now. He's proven it. He's beaten everybody multiple times, I think Rafa, Novak, myself. That's what you got to do, and hopefully you can string those matches together when it really matters in slams. But the tour is just not only slams, you know. He's having another good year. I'm happy for him because he's a good player.","You're playing Stockholm next, right?",Uh-huh.,I think this year your schedule has been busy for the latter part of the year. What was the reason behind adding Stockholm?,"Yeah, I mean, last year I had quite a few things happening through the summer, you know, winning French, winning Wimbledon, playing well in the summer, having twins, getting married, you name it. I could have done it, come here as well. But I just needed a rest. I was tired. This year, obviously the French and Wimbledon were nothing as brutal as last year. That's why also for me it was a big priority at the beginning of the year so I could play Shanghai. I was considering either playing, you know, the week before Shanghai or the week after. But I felt like I owed Stockholm to come back there. Good friends with Bjorkman and Johansson, who run the tournament there now. Disappointment pulling out there a couple years ago. That was the decision behind that. I hope also by playing Stockholm, this was half indoor tournament already, which is good for what's to come now. I hope it's going to help me playing well in Basel, Paris and then London. Still a lot of points to pick up and many important events for me.",UNK,UNK, 
28,1631,5879,"When do you start thinking about that game, the match?","Yeah, you know, when I'm out there.",Anytime before?,"Well, I have a doubles final, so I'm pretty focused on that. And that comes before the semis [sic], so, yeah, I'll think about that.",You played singles and doubles here. Physically are you feeling good? Has it flattened you at all?,"I don't think it's flattened me. I think it's helped me. You know, I get a lot of extra practice, so... I think I spent a lot of time on the court. But, you know, I like being out there.","When you think about some of the great matches you've had with Justine, can you just talk about what comes to your head.","Well, uhm, you know, so many. So I just always meet her in the quarterfinals. I don't know how many times we've played in the finals. I know we played once in Miami in the finals. She was doing everything and beating me really bad. I managed somehow to come back. I don't know how. I don't really think about one match in particular.","Are the 2007 quarterfinals still in your head, the three in a row?","I clearly don't remember, so...",No,No, 
271,377,1342, , ,"How did you feel out there, first match back since Wimbledon?","I felt good, you know. It's always nice to be back on the match courts, you know, after spending so much time on the practice courts. I was happy with my performance today. It was a tough match, because Fred was serving really well and made it hard to get any kind of rhythm because I was serving well myself. It was a good first match, and I'm pleased I'm through.",Can you take us through the process of deciding to play here rather than waiting for an extra week to come back?,"Well, I mean, it was -- it all depended on Mirka, if she wanted to make the trip or not, and obviously if the babies were going to be ready to do it or not. It really all depended on that. That's why I kind of mentioned it to her like one week before the event starts here, and I went from day to day, and at the end we said, all right, I think everything looks all right. And like this, we going to be anyway then together for a long time in North America. That's what she wanted. That's what I wanted. That's why we decided to do it that way.","This was probably the last match for Frederic in Montreal. Tell us about your relationship, what you think about him as a player and a person?","Well, we know each other since I guess 11 years, because we played each other in, I think it was in '97 or '98 in the Swiss Satellite in front of -- you know, like I said on court like in front of two people, and other guys were playing next to us. The atmosphere was rather cold because it was a Winter Satellite in Switzerland and there was a ton of snow outside. Next thing you know, 11 years later we're playing in front of a packed house here in Montreal. It's a long time coming for both of us. A lot has happened since, but we kind of always, when we saw each other on tour, we always tried to maybe hit together or at least have a chat together. I always had a lot of news also from the Swiss players of how he was doing, and he's a very nice man. Of course, it's always sad when you leave the game, but he seems at peace with himself by doing this big step. I can only wish him the best.","Obviously after a few weeks off there is some rust you have to shake off. How much of what you did out there tonight was rust and how much of it, if any, was adjusting to your new routine, your new lifestyle? Was there any part of that into it? Did you have to make some adjustments, some changes?","Well, in the beginning after, let's say, five, six weeks of not having played a match, because you play practice matches but that's not the same, you're just a little bit slow sometimes, your reaction on the return. Maybe your shoulder is a little bit slower as well, you know, after having only played practice matches. But, you know, today all in all, I thought it was okay. I wish I could have gotten more balls back on the return, but then that is again due to him serving well and mixing it up well. But, you know, once there is not much rhythm from the baseline, it's always kind of difficult, and then it comes down to a couple of points here and there and that's how this match was being played, as well, today.",Yes,Yes, 
263,9695,35297,Have you made up your mind on Davis Cup yet?,"Well, I mean, I announced I'm not going to play.  That won't change.",Are you going to watch tonight?,"Yeah, I will.","Do you get excited watching this kind of match on TV?  Third round, pretty unusual.","Doesn't matter if it's Nadal/Kohlschreiber, Hewitt against somebody, Roddick/Safin, for me it's the same.  I enjoy watching night sessions at Grand Slams, see them battle it out.  This one is definitely entertaining because I know the guys very well since a long time.  These are the strongest guys basically we have on tour.  It's going to be an entertaining match.  I think the last one they played here was a five-set thriller.  They played in Davis Cup since. No, I think it's going to be a close match.  Don't know who to give the favorite to.","Does it give you a nice feeling watching two blokes, two of your strongest rivals, knocking the stuffing out of each other in the third round?","Yeah, it's good to see an early contest like this in the tournament, not having to wait for it till the semis or something.  You're never sure if both are going to get through, counting me and Raf and everybody the same. It's good to see them face off.  I always wonder, you know, if it's just going to come down to the day for them or if somebody has improved.  One guy just finished a great season; the other guy just won Davis Cup.  I think it's going to be a great match.",Late in the third set you had zero challenge shots left.  You looked a little frustrated.  Wish you might have had one or two extra there?,"No.  I wish I had none all the time, so...  Nothing's changed (smiling).  You know that.",Yes,Yes, 
51,21848,79377,Did you have to change anything during the match or like in the third set? Did you change tactics at all?,"Yes. I think in the second set I just -- well, she came up and she started to play better than in the first set, I think. I tried to make winners when I shouldn't, so I gave her too many points. I tried to keep the ball a little bit more in the court and give her always another ball to play.","Have you been playing particularly well as of late, or did you just find some great form during qualifying and coming into this match?",I think I find it during this match.,So it's just once? Nothing particularly good has been happening this year for you?,"Well, this year I haven't win many matches. Just in Bogot on clay, then I was in Acapulco on clay, and then in Monterrey last week on hard court. I've been playing better and better, but this was my best match I did so far.",Did you always know that you were capable of beating a player as good as she is?,"Well, I have never done that. I beat Marion Bartoli, who was 11 last year. So I didn't expect it, to be honest, but I'm very happy about it.",Are you going to keep this strategy that you played today for your next match?,Yeah. I think so.,Yes,Yes, 
95,9381,34223,What was your reaction to the investigation of Davydenko?  Have you spoken with him?,"I don't care about what the people.  It's their business.  I don't want to be involved with that.  I want to be outside of that.  I don't want to hear the stories.  I don't want to know anything.  I'm not really interested. If Davydenko, he has to answer some questions into his life, the life of ATP, I'm going to stay out of it.",This is the only major with a breaker in the fifth set.  Do you think that should change?,"Of course, it should change.  Of course.  They should've changed last year.  If I win a couple of them I would be not 25, I would be 15.  This was a huge change.  But unfortunately I lost all of them.  Hopefully it will not happen again. Half of it is a lottery.  Of course, when you don't have a confidence it's tough to win then because it's just a matter of one, two points, and the nerves of course are jumping a little bit more than a usual set.",You won a challenge today.  Do you still disbelieve the camera thing?,Hawk-Eye?,Yes.,What happened with it?,You have never really agreed it was accurate before.,"No, well, it's much better than not to have it for sure because the serves are going pretty fast.  It's pretty difficult for the chair umpire to make a good decision. You're taking such responsibility.  Imagine it happens 6-All in a tiebreak in the fifth set, you want to kill the guy.  If he makes a mistake and you know he is making mistake, but at least you have a chance to see it and a chance to prove it, be more relieved.",UNK,UNK, 
177,4941,18197, , , , ,Are we seeing the new Mario Ancic of the game?,"I don't know if it's new.  I have my own game, so I don't know.  It's good to compare me with Mario, because I am -- has a good game for his height.  So I think I should develop more as he is playing.  So I'm going to try to play more aggressively and try more to come into the net.",How does it feel to be in the fourth round of a major?,"I feel it's normal.  I mean, of course, feels -- it feels great. I mean, I played three very good matches.  I'm in good form.  My physical shape is quite good, and today was probably the best, the best match so far in my career.",Must be giving you confidence to make this kind of a run.,"I was doing quite a good preparation for before the season, and I played in Chennai very good, then also in Auckland.  I lost to Kohlschreiber in three sets where he played quite a good match, and then I came here. I mean, I started very good with the first round.  Second round was a little bit tougher, but today was good for my that we played with the roof closed, so it was -- it was easier to play.  It was better for me. I could take control of the point and I wasn't letting him to develop his game.",UNK,UNK, 
197,20932,76077,That's a quality win over a tough opponent. Talk about it.,"It was good. I played well. Pretty solid. I felt good out there. I mean, I don't really know what else to say. I looked good. I was happy.","Was winning a title important to you, and does it make you feel any different as a tennis player?","It was important, yes, because now everyone can stop talking about it. (Smiling.) It doesn't really I don't feel any different. It's kind of just like it's there when you click on my link. On the ATP app it says one title.",ATP?,"Hello. The WTA app, sorry. But you know when you look at it it says ATP/WTA. Sorry. Yeah, it says one title, but other than that it's kind of like, all right, I did it. Yay. Let's move on.","But obviously you have gone deep in majors. Can you compare and contrast those levels of satisfaction, or was it, Yay, we're moving on?","Yay, eh. I don't know.",What makes you feel really satisfied?,"I mean, that was definitely satisfying. It was something I really worked hard for. Like definitely something once I got it, it was like, Whew, great, I'm happy. Waited for it for a long time, and then the next day was Monday. Then I kind of just had to move on. I mean, there is nothing really to hang on to. It's like that day, the title, the trophy, yay. Then it's gone. It will always be there, but...",No,No, 
41,5221,19215,I saw your Facebook page today. I saw you were at spice market yesterday.,Uh-huh.,How was it?,"Yeah, it was really good. It was a really good night. It was the first time I had been able to venture out from the hotel and go out to dinner and see part of the city. So it was a really good few hours.",Does that show sort of further robustness you've got like when you lost like you did to Victoria only a couple nights ago and then you come out and completely turned it around?,"Yeah. I think it's just good, I guess, in a round robin situation there is -- I was thankful it wasn't my last match and had another chance to come out and try and, I guess, redeem myself and play better. If I lost tonight I wanted to, you know, lose on my terms and play well, at least. Obviously I didn't really get close to that, and I played really well from start to finish, and I'm glad that I'm now in the semis and have another chance to try and do it again.",You're 7 and 2 this year against top 5 players. What do you sort of put that down to? Obviously you've really been able to perform against the really best players.,"Yeah, I don't know. I guess it's always good to have a record like that. For some reasons the last couple of years I have been able to have good records against top 10 players, top 5 players. I think I go into those matches thinking I can play if I play well and really have no choice but to try and do that. And if you do, then I feel my tennis can match up well against anyone. I don't know. I guess I have managed to do that at the right time.","How does it feel, limping to the line or not even getting to the line really at the end of the season? How physically drained do you feel and mentally, as well, I guess?","I actually feel not too bad. I think, you know, the probably biggest mental challenge I have had through this year was probably at the start of the year and then after US Open. Trying to come and play those tournaments in Asia pretty soon afterwards was a really big challenge. So I think I hadn't played too many matches going into this event. I had a good week in Osaka but had a week off before coming in here and was able to kinda refresh myself. I had some days off. And when I'm not on the court, I'm not practicing, I'm trying to really zone out and not focus much on the tennis and really stay as fresh as what I can. But physically I feel fine, so I guess that's a good thing for the last hopefully two days of the year.",Yes,Yes, 
231,510,1909,Was the mental part a little harder to kind of overcome?  Because I noticed you're really hard on yourself if you lose a point.  You kind of shriek or smack yourself or scrape the racquet against the ground.  Is that something your coach wanted you to try to put the point behind and you just kind of focus ahead?,"Yeah, for sure, I think every point is important.  You have to control yourself.  Sometimes I do, and I think that's what I want to do.  And I just have a little bit of a -- I think I'm really feisty on the court, and it's one of my - not weapon, but it's -- I think if I was not that like this in that match, maybe it would have went the other way, because I really believe in myself and I wanted every point, so I think it's a good thing.",What will you be doing to prepare for your mechanics next match?,"After here I'll do my stretching and stuff.  But I will -- I will just look in the -- focusing on myself after the match and do my stretching.  And for sure, I will play it like if it was another match.  Even if she's in the top 10 and she's a good player, I will just keep doing my thing that I'm doing with my routine and my coaches.  And I think everything's going to be good.","Well done today.  Can you talk a little about the belief and self confidence that you take out as a result against such an experienced player?  Because I think you're playing Petrova in the next round, so that's another step-up itself.  What does a result like that do to your own self belief as a young and aspiring professional?","For sure it means a lot to me.  I think I gave everything that I had today.  She's a great player, and I had the chance to play against a girl like that, and I just believe in me and my shots. And for sure, playing against another top 10 player, it's really great, and I'm really looking forward to play against her.  For sure it's an opportunity for me.  It's here in Canada, Toronto, and I love to play here, so it's going to be great.  It's going to be a battle tomorrow.",Did your opponent today say anything after the match to you like congratulations or anything?,You usually only we say good match to each other.  And she was really nice after the match., , ,Yes,Yes, 
186,10369,37733,Another main draw; another pro win.,Yeah.,"At this point, is this not new for you anymore? Is it getting to where you almost expect yourself to get past the first round?","Yeah, I mean, for sure. I definitely feel really good. Just having to qualify really just gives me a sense of entitlement when I get into the main draw. I earned my way into here, and so now I got two matches, good matches, underneath my belt. Now just gotta keep the ball rolling. I do expect myself to do well and win a couple of rounds because I know I can. I reached third round of a Grand Slam, so I know I can do whatever. So, I mean, hopefully go farther than that. So, yeah, it's positive. I'm just moving in the right direction and learning from every match.","Heading into the US Open, you have been third round obviously like you say. What kind of expectations do you have? Are you trying not to put pressure on yourself? What's the frame of mind?","I'm going into the Open confident. I think playing these matches and being able to play here and playing in D.C. kind of gave me some really good a lot of confidence leading up into the Open. I'm still not done yet. I'm getting some doubles play here so when I go to the Open as well I'm going to be fresh and ready to go. As far as expectations for myself, I mean, I just want to continue to do my best, lay everything out on the line, fight as hard as I can, and learn, you know. I mean, I'm put in a position in matches where I'm like, Oh, I have been here before. How can I improve from the last match or something like that? I'm just trying to take the step to continue to learn and do the right things. I know that the results if I continue to work hard and keep learning, the results will take care of themselves.","It seems like you're working hard. A lot of matches that you're winning are 75 in the third or 76 or 64. Is that a good thing, getting yourself like time to stay in the point and pull it out?","Yeah, I mean, I think that you've got to do what you gotta do to win. Really, that's what I'm proving to myself. It's like, you know, it comes down to the wire in these matches or a point here and there, and, you know, I can win that point and that can change the match. It came down to one or two points today. So, I mean, these last couple of matches and especially in D.C.  have given me just a lot of confidence to know that, you know, when I get put in these situations, number one, I can come out of it; and number two, if I get in that situation again I know that I have been there before. I know that I can come out of it and I know what I can do and how to make myself click in those moments.",What did you like most about the way you played today? Was it the mental thing you just talked about?,"Yeah, for sure. I definitely don't think that I played my best. But at the same time, I did what I had to do to win. She's a very tough person to play. She hits really, really flat. Her serves, she mixes it up. Goes from slow to pops an ace on you. You really have no rhythm. So I just tried to really focus on myself. It came down to a point here or there. Like I said, for me I just tried to fight and stay in the moment. I had two match points and missed two returns. Instead of getting upset at that I just tried to focus on the next game and holding my serve and having another opportunity to take it.",UNK,No,UNK?
136,9,35,Do you think part of it also is you're from the Ukraine and they pulled out the old war words come back?,"No, I doubt that there was many people from post Soviet Union in my match. I don't really think that -- I heard some people cheering in Russian, so I don't know. Maybe 20, maybe 50. But if there's 50 against, I don't know, how big is Grandstand? Couple of thousand. So not easy.","You come in coming off the win in New Haven, and you've reached for the first time your third round in a Grand Slam. If I'm not mistaken, do you feel now at 24 years of age coming in with, I would think, confidence off the New Haven win and now, you know, coming into the third round, do you feel right now this is a big turning point in your career?","Well, I would say it's a turning point for my Grand Slam career, because unfortunately before I was not able, or due to bad draws, I would say. But it's an excuse. I was unable to pass through two rounds. So for me it's a great opportunity to play third round. I would say it's a huge turning point in my career, because New Haven was the second title this year. I had one before. It was my fourth in total, so I do have some experience in that. I'm still now looking for my game, still trying to get better in the game I'm playing.","Coming off the win, do you feel right now that your own expectations of yourself has risen?","Um, not really. I'm just -- as long as I'm on court I'm just trying to win, more or less, and I'm trying to win every point, or, you know, sometimes put a little show in there. But I'm just trying to enjoy it. I'm just trying at the moment not to be angry on myself if I'm losing.",So you're enjoying yourself?,"Yeah, I do.","When he was serving at match point, are you surprised he didn't try and hit a harder serve?","Second serve, I think. Seriously, I don't know if it was soft or not soft. I know he missed it and that was enough for me.",No,No, 
26,13222,48212, , , , ,You had kind of a slow start today.  Can you talk about how you got into the match and what you were thinking at the beginning?,"Well, a little bit in the beginning a little bit nervous.  Every match is very difficult because you play only against the best.  So I start the match with, well, little bit doubts, no?  But later I play a little bit more aggressive. Very important was do the break in the beginning of the second.  I finish much better than I start, no?","You did a really good job this time, but at the same time I noticed that your opponent also did a good job and won the first set.  Could you make some comments on those young players, about the same age as you, coming up this year like Novak and Richard?","Well, the tennis, I don't know how much years, but every year the new players come, no?  Right now the tour in very good positions, very young players is coming, no?  Djokovic, me, Gasquet, Berdych, Monfils, Del Potro, Murray, a lot of players, very young players the same age like me or one less, no? So is nice for the tennis, too, and is nice for me because I played against these players when I was in juniors, I have 14 years old.",I noticed that your knees are still taped up.  Could you give us an idea how you're doing physically and how you felt out there?,"Everything perfect.  So no comments about the knees, because I can't comment nothing because is perfect.",Yes,Yes, 
273,6605,24175,There were times when you were up two sets to none when Robredo had won something like 13 or 14 more total points in the match.,That's what I'm saying.,Did you have a sense? You could feel that sort of?,"For sure. I know he had a lot of break points, didn't convert them more than me. You know, I was able to win those first two sets. You know, but that's just how it goes sometimes. He was, like I said, he probably was the better player out there. He might have won more points than me, period, and lost there you go. You know, only won one set. It's kind of crazy. I'll take it, but it's, like I said, it needs to get a little better.","On the women's side, top three seeds are out already, and third round is not even over. Do you ever wish that could happen on the men's side? Because that never happens.","Last year at Wimbledon, I was in that section that Rafa and Roger, I think I was the highest seed when those guys went out and unfortunately I got hurt. It doesn't happen too often on the men's side, but I guess it did last year at Wimbledon. No, you know, I mean, in order to win a Grand Slam, you've seen, you've got to go through at the very minimum two of the top guys. That's what it seems like, they're always there.",How would you describe the clay here? What makes it special? How dirty does it leave you on your clothes?,"Dirty? Yeah, it's great clay. I mean, it's probably the best in the world, I think. I mean, they do such a good job keeping the courts in very good shape. More than that, I mean, just as in every Grand Slam, I think it's the atmosphere that really makes this tournament. You know, really got a global audience watching this event for us. So, yeah, the clay here, you know, it's not something I play on too much, but it's something I enjoy playing on. And, yeah, I get extremely dirty, but luckily they have great laundry service in the locker room and I just turn it in and don't have to deal with it.","You said on a few occasions when the subject of American tennis came up, you don't really care what other people are doing or what historical lows have been reached. Does the reverse apply here? You have broken the second week streak that goes back to Roddick. Does that not matter or...","Yeah, I mean, that's cool for me. It's not something I think about too much, but at the same time, I'm going to really be pulling on Jack and Donald tomorrow. It would be pretty nice to sock it to all you guys, we have three guys in the round of 16. It's doable, too. I think they have obviously very tough matches, but very winnable matches, as well. It would be nice to have three of us in the round of 16. I'll be cheering hard for those guys.",UNK,No,UNK?
141,17697,64149,"Tough end to the week, but still overall can you take positives from your experience here?","Of course. I mean, it's always great to be here. But of course nobody is expecting easy matches here, so unfortunately I have some tough ones as well. So, well, but hopefully, you know, that will give me some more lesson and experience for the next time.","Simona told us that she used to struggle against you, felt like she mentally struggled against you. How would you say she's changed over the past year? You've played here a couple times.","Well, that's actually weird, because we played two times this year and it was really good two matches. It was actually 1All. So pretty similar conditions: play on hard court but outside. So those two matches in the beginning of the year was pretty similar. Well, I think she was just too good today.","Is it strange to kind of lose three matches in one tournament? Strange format, no?","Well, I mean, this is a tournament, like I was saying before, even if you're losing you can still going forward. Of course in the beginning maybe my first time in the Champs it was always weird. Now I think when you go here you can expect that.",What was it about Simona's game today that perhaps you struggled a little bit against?,"I think she was very solid from the beginning. No mistakes. Everything coming back. Changing lines. You know, deep balls. Serving very well. I think everything was working for her today, I guess.","The way the group wound up working out, you only got to the semifinals because you won second set against Sharapova from 51 down. So is that more of a point of pride now than it was maybe right after that match? That was what you needed to, save all the match points and do this ridiculous comeback.","Yeah, well, of course I knew about that. I was still fighting for that semis, even though I was 51 down. That's why to maybe happened like it happened. So, well, it was good to be in the semis of course. Always disappointing to lose, especially 2 and 2. But, well...",UNK,No, 
265,7050,25728, , , , ,"Tell me if really in your mind you thought it was possible to happen this so easily, three sets to love of the champion of last Wimbledon?","Well, I wouldn't call it easy. I think it was just a tense match if you think about it. Since the first ball we hit on that court, we were both ready to win. But still I think I got early on in the match on top of him, and I think that really helped me, you know, progress in that way. I think second and third set was just a little different. But, I mean, I can't say much about the match because I came out to win the match. I was really positive. I was ready. I had a lot of patience no matter how many sets I was supposed to play. But I was just composed and I was looking for every point that I had to play.",So are you surprised or not?,"No. Why would I have to be surprised? It's a good feeling. I'm not going to hide that. It's a great feeling. I'm proud of what I did. But it's something that I've worked for, to get onto that stage, come out, and switch to another gear. It's a quarterfinal match, playing against the defending champion, against a gentleman like Andy. That adds a lot. In the same time, it's just another match for me. Yeah, I'm happy I'm through in three sets.",In your TV interview after the match you mentioned you noticed Andy didn't look quite right in the warmup. What did you notice?,I think it's just a feeling. I've practiced quite a few times with him. I know how he's striking the ball when he's at his best. I know how he's playing when he's not at his best. I think it's just a feeling that I had.,No,No, 
0,1408,5160,"I would like to ask you something. Well, you have lost rather quickly and you lost your focus. Is it because you realized that against Rafa there is not much you can do?","No, not at all. Well, look at what I did at MonteCarlo; I won. I played many quarterfinals during my career as a tennis player, so I don't really know what happened today. It wasn't my day. A bit of a strange day, an odd day. I hope it's not going to happen again.",What do you think about Rafa?,"Well, at the beginning he didn't really play well, but then afterwards he improved his game, and I think he's going to play a lot better next match.","There are still four players for the semis. Well, I know it's off the cuff, but would you say that Rafa is going to reign again this year?","Well, you know, Rafa and Djokovic are still the two favorites, but let's not forget about Murray. He's playing excellent tennis. He has many qualities and skills on clay. However, I think that Rafa is the favorite.", , , , ,UNK,UNK, 
244,21107,76753,"When you left Australia, you were frustrated with how you played and how things went. Were you sure that in a month, maybe two months if you kept working hard, that your tennis would come back?","Sure. You're never sure. You never know. But I was believing, you know. I still think that there is still much more work to do for me to come back, you know. You know, like I said, with each win it gives me a little bit of inspiration, like come on, keep believing. Because after Australia there was a moment I came to Moscow for the Fed Cup. I said to my mom, I said, I'm retiring. I said, I don't want any more of this. I really honestly said, because for me it was tough, because I knew that I'm gonna start from the next week with a new coach. And, like, it was a moment that was going in my mind, like, Will I be back? So things got -- you know, there is a saying, you know: Never give up; you know.",What did your mother say to you when you said that to her?,"Well, I mean, for her she said, like, Come on; be positive. I said, It's not about positive or negative. It's just like -- it's, like I was not happy being on the court anymore. So for me, it was tough, you know, because I love the sport. And once you're not enjoying it, you struggle, you know. Like this, like when you have some bad moments, like your head's falling down. But when you're believing, you're like, Okay, it's not my day. I'm just gonna keep working hard. So I change it around to practice, and really like David, he was really positive every time, because there were moments in the practice I would go down. He's like, Come on; keep it up; let's work hard. I mean, thanks God it's paying off.",Have you ever dealt with anything like that before where you've been that far down that you felt like it wasn't fun anymore?,"I was down, but not that down, you know. I was down, but still my ranking was 20. I would be like it was two years ago in 2008, also, Australian Open. I lost to qualifier. I mean, she's a good player, but it was a tough moment for me, and then things suddenly turned everything my way. Now my rank was 115, and then you think; like, Okay, you start to do things like this, you don't get in. I'm not getting in here, not there, wildcard. I mean, you still don't know if they gonna give you wildcard or not. So that was a moment they say, Okay, let's play quallies. I said, Whew, yeah, I will have to play quallies or go to a smaller tournament. But it was a little bit shocking experience, you know. Like sometimes you ask for the wildcard and they say, like, Okay, we will let you know. And it's never letting you know. So...",Could you talk a little bit about the tough moment you went through after the French Open? Your loss to Kimiko Date? You mentioned it was a tough loss in your career.,"Well, it was a tough loss because I really enjoyed playing in Paris, and like I've been up in the third set and I lost the match. It was tough moment for me. But honestly, I think this last year and the beginning of this year was really -- was not the nicest experience, but I guess it will make me stronger. Because, you know, also you making two months offseason and you're coming and you're picking up the games.","If you could go back over the past stretch and change one thing, what would you change?","I think I would -- after the injury, I would take more time and come back. I think I came back a little bit too early. That was my mistake. I think I should have maybe not to play Stuttgart or Madrid and just to go to French and really to practice. I think this was a little bit of my mistake. Or even I would say not to play anymore last year, because it was -- and I never had chance to get ready, because it was all about my back. Like how do I feel? How I wake up? I mean, I play two tournaments, and then I injured again my back before Wimbledon. So at that moment, I think I should have really stopped and, you know, take time to recover full and to come back maybe end of the season, but not rushing it. I was rushing. I wanted to play, and then end up in the worst situation. So this was my worst mistake.",UNK,UNK, 
100,1131,4133,You feel all right now?,"Yeah, better.",How far do you think you are from your best?,"It's very difficult to say. You know, some matches like in Australia I was feeling great, but again, I mean, it was very important to see that I can win. I win two good matches, with Caroline, I win another good matches like with Julia Goerges. I mean, few good matches. I have played already in four tournaments this year. I played 20 matches. I mean, it's a lot. It's quite good to have so much game experience. Next level, I just need to compete and win against good top players. So far I have not had these matches. But in Australia, I mean, I felt that I can be quite close. Just a matter of time.","When you did so well in Australia, do you regard this as any kind of a setback, this trip?",Excuse me?,"You did so well in Australia, very well. You haven't done quite so well on this trip now. Do you see that in any way as a setback?","You know, I mean, if I come back and I expect to win everything, it's quite difficult. You know, Australia was really good. Here it didn't go so well, but again, I mean, I had still lots of matches. I think I just need to be patient and keep working, and I think it will pay back one day.","Serena Williams said she thought it was weird that you haven't been given a wildcard. She said that you were a great player, and she suggested it was something that she would have expected. Do you feel anything similar to that, or how do you feel about what she said?","No, I mean, I read what she said, that she wouldn't play the tournament. You know, the thing is it's not so many like schedule in ways. It's not so many tournaments to play. I wouldn't play it, either, you know, because I think I deserve to have a wildcard. But in my situation, I just have to go through this patch. I mean, not many players that would say just, you know, I'm not gonna play. But it's also good way to look at it. But then I see another way, that I have to still be humble. I still have to prove that I can do it and I can go through quallies. It's very weird, believe me, to play quallies. You're like you cannot turn yourself on, like where I am? Am I playing quallies for real? It so weird, but still, I made it through, and I hope I don't have to do it again. I do feel that I deserve wildcard, but, you know, sometimes it's hard situations. But I appreciate support of Serena.",UNK,UNK,

I'm asking because I'm playing in the media tournament.,"Oh, okay.",Could you arrange me?,"Electrolytes, Gatorade, a lot of water, bananas, whatever it takes.  Good luck, huh?  Is everyone playing?  Someone need some coaching?","Before the third set, exactly what -- before you went in, had the bananas and the electrolytes, how were you feeling exactly?  I mean, your legs felt heavy or you just felt exhausted?","Yeah, I was starting to feel a little tired, but that break really helped me.  And just mentally, I just tried to forget about the second set as soon as I could and really tried to focus on the third one.","I was wondering if you've ever been able to watch the tape of your final against Martina Hingis here, and if so, what do you think when you sort of see yourself from back then?","Definitely I watched it many, many times, especially after the finals.  And it was a great feeling.  And, you know, whenever you watch match like that, it brings so many great memories.  And I could feel exactly what I, you know, what I was thinking in those moments.  It was fantastic.",Yes,Yes, 
215,3239,11759,"When you were out at Stanford, Billie Jean King was there, celebrating the 40th anniversary of that tournament. When you hear about the grass-roots beginning of the women's tour, are you amazed how far you have come?","Oh, goodness, yeah. I mean, you look back, I think so many players take what we have for granted because I think without, you know, people like Billie Jean King, I mean, we wouldn't have the opportunity not only to play in such big and great events, we wouldn't have equal prize money. We wouldn't have someone that was so strong behind so many issues. We wouldn't be getting paid so much. So many of those things you realize were done at a point where I think then, you know, none of those players really knew what was going to happen 20 years from then, how much effect and how much of what they did really mattered to the upcoming generation. I think that's something that all of us really have to look at today and say what we do now is ultimately, when we're done and retired, whatever we're doing with kids, families, commentating, whatever it is, we're going to have some sort of piece, a part of what's going to happen in years to come. We really have to be thoughtful. When I talk to Billie Jean King, she says, There's always going to be somebody in your spot. No matter how you do, how much you achieve, there's always going to be the next person that comes along that's going to be No.1. There's going to be tons of them coming ahead. But at this point you guys are setting the bar for the younger generations to come. We are. We try to be good examples by doing that.",What do you remember about last year's Melanie match here? It was probably a low moment. What were some of the memories about that night?,Why do we need to remember that one?,You and Michael Jordan are with Nike.

No, I think our schedules are too busy for everyone to get together, yeah.", , , , ,UNK,Yes,Negated question
98,3974,14511,The roof made it hard to pick up the ball?,"Yeah, it was just a little awkward. It went in between the rafters and then you see it and then it hits the piping and then it comes back out. I just misstimed it. I guess it's lack of being in there, the surroundings. That's how it goes.","How about a nicer, more pleasant memory that you'll take away?","I mean, I'd have to say some of those crazy points, dropshot, blah, blah, blah, back and forth, hit a good volley, got the crowd going.","Can you possibly compare TeamTennis on the one hand, which is team, coed, rowdy, American, unconventional, versus Centre Court, traditional, English? Can you compare the two?","Yeah, I mean, I think going into it I thought it would have been a little bit more tamed. Maybe because the roof was closed it seemed 10 times louder. But I kind of felt kind of the same out there. After a crazy point, pumping my fist, have the crowd, you know, enjoying it, clapping, I just felt like it was kind of the same environment.", , , , ,Yes,Yes, 
36,15704,56968,Does it mean you'll enter the court even stronger compared to your semis against him in New York?,"Well, in New York I think I played a great match against him. He's very aggressive player, maybe the most aggressive there is on the tour. You have to be patient. Again, put some varieties and get him out of comfort zone. I've played so many times against him. He knows my game really well, as I know his. We played very close matches, last five matches except the one in London. Semifinals of a Grand Slam is very unpredictable what's going to happen. If I play well, this is my only Grand Slam that I won. I love the atmosphere and the conditions on center court.","It appears that the difference between Rafa and Federer, you and Murray, with the rest of the players is growing in the tournament. Do you see it that way?","Well, yeah. Maybe it's -- you know, maybe it's one of the explanations why we have that little gap with the other players. But I think there is more players now that are able to win against top two guys. Federer and Nadal have been very dominant in the last five, six years. All the credit to them. They're very strong mentally. They keep coming back for more titles. They're playing better in the later stages of the Grand Slams and any tournament. It's hard to keep up with them, but this is what you learn playing with those two guys. With the experience, I've gained that state of mind. I'm just feeling better every year that I play on the court.",You said before going against Federer you feel like you've got nothing to lose. Do you feel like you're going into the match on equal terms or as the underdog?,"I cannot compare my success to him. Of course he's the main favorite next to Nadal to win the title of any tournament they play on. They're the best two players in the world. As I said, I have to be confident on the court, have the right attitude, and that's the only way I can beat Roger or Rafa. There is no other way. If you go out there and try to play your best tennis, you don't deserve to be there. You're not going to get any positive outcome.",So is confidence the only difference in past matches when you weren't succeeding against Federer?,"I always try to win against him. No question about that. I've won against him in different occasions, mostly on the hardcourts. So as I said, this is the chance that I can use. But as I said, very close matches. The winner of the matches, you know, gets away with couple points here and there. On this level, this is what happens.","I guess one of the important things against Roger is not to let him get on top of you quickly, to get into the match. Once he gets in front he's pretty hard to stop.",Definitely. Definitely you have to start well. You have to try to get him on the run as much as you can and try to let him know you're there to win.,UNK,UNK, 
61,433,1569,"What's next for you, sort of the next couple of months?","Well, I head back home, take, you know, probably a good two, three weeks off and just kinda do whatever I want, and then I'll get stuck into the fitness training for 10 days to two weeks and maybe have the odd hit during that period. And then really from December really start focusing about being on the court and putting most of my energy into on the court rather than off the court. So, yeah, it's gonna be, I'm sure, very busy, because it's the part of the year that I always try and make sure I enjoy and really do whatever I need to do to get prepared for the year ahead.","With what's happening the last few months, would you almost want the season to continue or are you pretty much ready for that break?","No, it's funny. I already said cooling down in the gym, it was the same thing last year, I got to the Championships and felt like I started playing really well again, almost didn't want to stop. Now I it could probably say the same thing now, but obviously it's been a long year and you always look forward to that break. But certainly it's now makes you eager to do that training and get into the next year.","If Petra wins tomorrow, she's going to be No.2, and she'll be pretty close to Caroline going into the new year. Could you just compare and sort of contrast their respective games from a player's perspective?","Well, I think Petra plays a lot more aggressive. She's, you know, got a lot more visible, I guess, weapons than what Caroline has. But what Caroline, you know, does very, very well is, you know, things that, you know, that a normal tennis fan may not necessarily see. I mean, she moves well, competes extremely hard, and really makes you work for it; whereas Petra, you can see those flashes of great, great tennis. Yeah, two probably different styles, but, you know, I think, you know, Petra is a very exciting player to watch and probably deserves to be in that No.2 spot if she does win.","Of the maybe under 23 players that are out there right now, does she look to you, Petra, like the one with the skill? She can be erratic and she plays a high-risk game, but does she look like she has the skills that can really consolidate and be a solid No.1 player?","Yeah, I think she's definitely capable of being that No.1, in that No.1 position, and, you know, it's funny. She's very, very young, but already from when I first saw her when I played her at the French a couple years ago till now, it's amazing how much she's been able to improve. And even from when I played her at the Aussie Open till now, I think she's taken huge strides. She's got the game where you will see maybe a flurry of errors, but then you'll flip it over and you'll see that streak of winners. So I'm sure as she gets older she will only make that better and better. Yeah, I think she's capable of doing very good things.",The men are still talking about the length of their season. You were saying you feel pretty good at this stage. Do you feel that's a sign that the women have got it just about right in terms of length of the year?,"Yeah. I think for sure the last few years I think we've, on the women's side, really got a tournament schedule where, you know, you can make good decisions and make a good schedule and putting good breaks throughout the year so that you do still feel relatively fresh at this point in time. And now, to have two months off, I think it's obviously the best part we've ever been in before. Looking at the guys, I think it's crazy that they still have another month to play. And they go off and do all their XOs in that time as well. They kind of complain about it but don't make the situation any better for themselves, either.",Yes,Yes,

You had four game points in there and you couldn't put any of them away.","Yeah, she played some good points and hung in there.  I have to give her credit for that.",Is there any one of those points that you didn't convert that you really regret?,"There's quite a few points I would have chosen, not just one.  If I could choose, I'd choose to win every point.",Do you feel like you played the wrong shot on any of those four points?,"I don't really remember exactly the four points.  It was a long game, actually.",Do you think that she won the game or that you lost the game because of the unforced errors?,"I think I definitely had a lot more unforced errors than she did.  And even if I bring those down to half and just have as many as she does, I think the match would go a lot better for me. But the best part is that there's another tournament.","Is it more frustrating to lose this way than if you feel like you played well and you lost, but to feel like you kind of gave it away a little bit, does it hurt more?","Well, I definitely, when I step on the court, every time I definitely want to execute.  So for me I'm not satisfied when I don't.  Well, certainly not.",UNK,UNK,

It's been an exciting week for you?,"Yeah, it's obviously been a great and I love Brisbane. Hopefully I will be back here next year. And, again, it's a good practice before Australian Open.

That's why he's a champion. He always plays at 1,000%. He will not make the mistake of underestimating his opponent. Because we played many times, he knows me, and sometimes I pushed him to a third set.",You will play in front of a French crowd tomorrow. Do you believe they're going to support him or you? Is it going to be difficult for you?,"He is very popular, and it will be normal that part of the crowd supports him. As I said, I appreciate him a lot as a person, so I will be happy whatever happens, even if the crowd is divided.",Is it going well with Ricardo when he briefs you?,"Yes. We will talk before the match. The whole issue is to find the right balance between attacking and defending. That is something I was able to do in my match today.

276,6532,23952, , ,Could you first just start off commenting on your thoughts on the match?,"It was a bad start for me because I lost the first game with the two balls to win the games. Then I won two games in a row, so I could be 3-Love and not 2-1. Then she served good, and I couldn't win that game. Then was so close for the rest of the set.","When you consider how well you were playing in the tournament, you've had four straight-set matches, pretty dominant performances, can you talk a little bit about your expectations coming in? Can you look back at this point and say, Hey, it was a good tournament? Do you feel you were playing good enough you could win today?","Of course is a good tournament. If I do second round and I give the best I can, it's good tournament. Of course, if I see a match like this, I want to win. Everybody want to win, so is no need to be upset. But I think today she served good, and with more wind she has more chance than me. Because when I was serving against the wind, I am 1 meter 66, and I try to push as much as I could. But is not like Venus -- she serve on second floor and with the big power. So it's okay. It's not okay, but it's okay.","You were down 4-0 in that first set tiebreaker, and then you came back with four straight points to tie it up. What happened from there? Kind of got away from you from there.","I think I lost the first point. The first point we fight and I miss a ball, so was my mistake. Then she serve good two points 3-love, or the opposite. I don't -- I don't remember really. But I think she play a little bit better in that moment, and I couldn't catch my opportunity. Then I played very high level and I came back. When we were 5-all, I missed two balls. She didn't win the point. I just missed two balls. That's tennis.","It's the end of the Grand Slam season. The Grand Slam season is over now, and you've had an incredible rebirth this summer or even breakthrough. I'm just wondering, what does it feel like now this summer? To do this so late, is this like a dream? Was it something you saw coming? Do you feel like you can step on it and use this foundation to go forward?","No, I think -- I'm positive. I don't finish my career here, so I want to play Australian Open and again French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open. So I have other opportunity to show and to do some more big results. So I am happy to have this chance. Of course, if I save this match, I say (in Italian.) How you say it in English? I have always the chance to beat her, and that's the way that I want to keep going, and one day I win the most important points. I know that. Is just plans of me. That's a good possibility, good way. But for sure, in the most important moments she's always there and play good. So I have to play better to beat her.",Yes,Yes, 
241,18131,65820,And for how long more?,I think just only two months.,How do you think you'll be feeling going into your next match?,"Well, yeah, it will be tough match if Iveta or Vera, from both sides. Iveta is good friends and Vera is No.2. So, yeah, I try my best also.","Can you play with a bit more freedom, a bit more relaxed?",I hope so.,Caroline Wozniacki play for Prostejov.,Yes.,Can you talk about that? Why did you do that?,"We were very happy she played with us with the Prostejov. It was a good group, and Caroline was very nice. So it was fun.",Yes,UNK, 
27,11927,43505, , , , ,Have you ever played anybody so hot like that before?,"I don't know.  He played well.  You know, I made more errors than I should have in the first.  After that, there's no doubt he was coming up with some shots tonight.",What was it like for you just being there at the end of that?,"It was frustrating.  You know, it was miserable.  It sucked.  It was terrible.  Besides that, it was fine.",What did Jimmy say to you straight after the game?,He gave me a beer.,UNK,UNK, 
275,18052,65541,Normally you hit a shot and you go forward. Today you were hitting a shot and you were going back. Do you have a problem on the back?,"Like I said, I was just trying to do the best I could today. Maybe I wasn't the best physically, but that had nothing to do with it. I think Ana just played a really good match. She did what it takes to win.",Seems every year in Australia you have something.,"I mean, maybe, maybe not. I have won this tournament five times, so it doesn't I don't think that necessarily means that I have something. I think I have done pretty well here. You know, in general, over the history. I feel like I'll win it again. Maybe just obviously not this year, but maybe next year.",Ana drew a lot of support from the crowd. Did you feel the crowd was against you at all throughout the match?,"I just felt like the crowd often goes for the underdog sometimes. And she was playing well, and she was hitting a lot of winners. I don't think the crowd was against me. I think they wanted Ana to play well.",Were you taken by surprise by her performance and how much she's improved perhaps in the last 12 months?,"No, I have been watching her play a lot. I think I have seen her perform well. She hit a lot of great shots today. I wasn't surprised at all, no.",What is the issue with your back specifically?,"To be honest, I don't know. Like I said, actually, I have no idea.",No,No, 
4,17945,65107,"The wrong result. You almost had it, didn't you?","I mean, yeah, of course, I have two match point. But I can do nothing for these two match point. I think also both player fighting a lot on the court. So, yeah.","Was your mental strength there, determination, your famous drive?","No, no, nothing.","Has she got one of the best serves you've faced? Your coach said to me, She serves like a man.","I mean, it is. I mean, start of the first point till the end of the match, every serve was like around 117 miles. I mean, this is impossible for the women.","How different was it for you coming in here as the French Open champion for the first time, as a Grand Slam winner, obviously a lot more attention from China? Was that a difference here playing at Wimbledon?","I didn't feel different. I didn't feel, like, pressure. I mean, only change is right now opponents see you different. So everyone play against you, they feeling nothing to lose. So they can play best tennis on the court. I mean, I don't think the player can stay same level like today. If like this, I mean, she's No.1 in the world, yeah.","Did the fact that your husband left halfway through the second set, did that affect you?","I don't know where he going. So after I find him, I will tell you (laughter).",Yes,Yes, 
122,11414,41618,"Do you mean that you will continue your schedule and keep on playing, or you will change your schedule and take some rest? What is your plan for the days after Shanghai?","Sure without think a lot about, because when you are on the bed for three days, the only thing you want to do is feel better, feel healthy again, and that's it. But my thoughts is continue with Basel, Paris and London. Is true that the last few months I was not in the best of luck. I didn't have the best of luck since Wimbledon. I was playing a good year, very positive year. After that I was unlucky with the wrist, what's going on now. Now remain three more tournaments for me. We'll see. Obviously the last couple of months have been little bit hard for me.","When you served for the second set, there were guys on the stand yelling out. Were you disrupted by them?","No. I am distracted by my bad game, not by nobody else.","You said your condition was almost the same as it was yesterday. Does that mean you're still in some pain, a little bit of pain, still?","Little bit of pain. But that's not the tougher thing now. Tougher thing always, as you know, when you have few days in bed, the process that I had, even today the doctors told me that I was very, very lucky that I had not to go for surgery straight, can save with antibiotics. You can imagine that all the treatment was little bit aggressive at the beginning. In three days I am playing. I am little bit more dizzy and feel with not much power than pain. Pain I think is under control. That's important. I think I was lucky for that. Unlucky for another things, but for this thing I was lucky.", , , , ,Yes,Yes, 
32,6294,23165,"What was the difference after the first set? Do you think he was attacking your second serves more, putting more pressure?",His second serve?,In the second and third set.,"Yeah, he try, but wasn't easy. I mean, he play good. He did all the shots good - even the serve, second serve bounce was high, so was tough to return. But I think the match was tight for both, even the second and third. 6-2 was tougher than that on the score. I feel that I play good. So I'm a little happy.",Was there anything different about Roger? Look like the same guy to you?,"Well, today he played really a high level. I think one of the best matches on clay court for him.",Do you think the main difference was on the physical side today?,"Well, maybe, yeah. I get a little tired in the second and the third. Was heat today, the first heat of the week, and I feel it. He played great. I mean, he never falls down a little bit. Even the second set when I break back, maybe I thought maybe I can win the match at that moment. And he never give up. So he play great.", , ,Yes,UNK, 
173,7798,28472,"Have you known he's had that talent all along? Is that something you'll see more of, as well?","Well, he's been quite consistent this year. He deserves to be top 20 I think with his qualities. He's a player that possesses a lot of talent and potential. There's a lot of expectations from him from Australia and all over the world for five, six years already he's playing on the tour. But he hasn't been able to really be consistent throughout the year. He's been playing well regularly in Australia, maybe grass courts, but other than that he wasn't really at his height. I think the difference this year is he's a little bit more professional. He's working a bit harder. It's paying off. I wish him all the best. I'm good friends with him off the court. We practice quite a lot. I think he's on the right way. He just needs to commit more. He understands now that the more he works, the better it is for him. Hopefully he's going to be even better in the future.",Sorry to ask something not about the match. You posted today in Weibo you played video games with your team. Do you think you are the top one in the ATP players video games?,"No, no, no. I'm far, far the worst. I don't play much. Last time I played video games was here last year. We have that in the players lounge. I played a little bit with my coaches who took the video console for the first time ever in their lives in their hands. You can imagine us playing that football video game. It was just for fun. It was more for shouting at each other, entertainment, than really playing seriously.",In your rest what do you do? Play games? Read books?,"I look at the ceiling (smiling). I spend a lot of time with my family whenever they're with me. Yeah, I like to read. I like to listen to music. Just spend time with my team and the people that I care about. I like other sports, of course. There's many things to do. It's just that sometimes time doesn't allow you.","Looking ahead to your next game in which you will face either Andy Murray or Tomas Berdych, how do you like the odds against each of them?","Well, I have positive score against both of the guys. I've played many timed against both of them. As a matter of fact, I've played against both players here in Shanghai couple of times. I know what to expect. I think the matchup between those two guys tonight is going to be interesting. Both of them, they're baseline players. Berdych has maybe a slightly better serve and more powerful game from the baseline. Andy has more options, more variety in his game. He's been on the top of the men's game for so many years, a Grand Slam winner, Olympic gold medalist, somebody that understands how to play on a big occasion. I don't see myself as a clear favorite tomorrow, whoever I play against. Again, I'll try to use the confidence and the kind of comfortable optimistic approach that I had to all the matches in these couple weeks in tomorrow's match will hopefully help me.",You know Tomas and Andy so well. Are you watching them play or expecting something new when you step up on the court against them?,"Certainly I do watch them play. I will watch this match. Probably not watch entire match, but as much as I can. My team will do, too, analyze my next opponent. Regardless of the fact that I've played them so many times, again, you want to see what kind of form they are in prior to the matchup against me. We'll do our job, and hopefully we can prepare ourselves well.",Yes,Yes, 
162,11227,40899,What are the perks of a diplomatic passport?,"I don't know. I just kind of got it. I think I get to go in a faster lane, you know, when you're... I don't know. When it comes to certain visas as well. I don't know really. I didn't use it yet to kind of know exactly the benefits. Maybe you can ask some other Serbian players, because when they were getting it I wasn't there. So, you know, I guess I was, I don't know, in the States or somewhere when they were receiving those passports. So those players that were there, they used it for many months. I just got it, and I still haven't used it because I still have my old one that has a few pages left. You know, because they give you a stamp, so until you get -- you know, you use, then, okay, you can take a new one.","Not coming from a small country like Serbia, can we really understand the impact of someone like yourself or Djokovic who gets to No.1 back at home?",What do you mean? How big...,I don't come from a small country like Serbia. Can we even understand the kind of impact that you've had at home?,"If you can believe, for example, for a country that has about maybe 8 million people and we have like three No.1s in the world in tennis, you know, I think that's pretty impressive. If somebody told us that when we began our careers, we would think it's a joke or it's not even -- it's like a mission impossible. But this shows that anything is achievable. Doesn't matter where you come from and what kind of facilities you have to train, if you're wealthy or poor. I think with the will and with the desire and the hunger, the determination, you can achieve anything. We showed that, and, you know, I'm pretty proud that we have done so well. It's really amazing success for Serbian tennis, and hopefully we will inspire other younger generations to come our way as well.",How do you feel about the combined men's/women's events? What did you see as the pros and are there some minuses?,"I think it's nice to have the combined event, especially now that we have these good facilities. We have lots of courts and big, you know, restaurants and big things that we can all fit inside. I think those are the biggest issues that if we didn't have, you know, like a big player lounge or some small places and then we they all come in, there is no place to sit and you have to stand and eat lunch. But we are lucky that we have good facilities and that we can all be here. It's nice for the fans to see men's and women's tennis and enjoy a lot of good tennis throughout the week. And as well for me. I like to watch men's tennis and as well learn from them and see how they play and pick up some tips and learn. So I'm happy that it is like this.","Before your match today, you were outside. Were you just trying to get away from all the bodies in the players' lounge?","Yeah, you saw me there? I can't hide from anybody, I guess.",UNK,Yes, 
178,15606,56575,Was there ever a point in the match where you felt you could turn things around or were you just playing from the line all the time?,"Well, key point, I guess it was in the first set when she broke me, because I had 30-Love, and then I missed easy forehand, and -- because of going for too much.  I knew I had to take the game in my hands, but I didn't do it. And then it was another key point, and I broke her back, and I -- she was serving the game and she broke me.  I think this was a key point.  If it would be, it would be totally different game.  But I mean, yeah, she played good game and she was on top today.","How good was her level today?  I mean, was that level good enough to win, like, a slam?","It's difficult to say.  I mean we both had a good week.  I never felt I was playing my best tennis in the tournament.  I didn't feel it.  And it's hard to me to say something like that.  Because to win the slam, you would have to face all top players.  And, like, Justine, Amelie, they were not here this week.  And then afterwards, other top players that lose early. And, for me, not to make final would feel very low.  At least I made it, you know.  It's good.  But still, I mean, I have to play next week, and I gonna face top players there, and it's gonna be very important for me.  And, yeah, just gonna have a good rest and improve my mistakes.",Do you find the conditions between here and Florida are much different?,"Well, last year I played here and after Florida, like two years or three years ago.  And it was hard for me.  Last year, I didn't play here, so it's hard for me to compare, but I think it's pretty different ones.","You both trained in the Casal/Sanchez Academy in Spain.  So it was a battle between two players from this academy, and between two coaches from this academy.  How much contributed to her success today, in your opinion?","Well, yeah, I mean, we train there, but she came there maybe two weeks or three weeks.  She got a coach there.  She been working, which improve her game.  But she comes on this higher level again. But, it's good to come here.  It's very tough, but it's also very tough to stay here.  So it would be the key for her, I guess, to work on.  But she would know better. But, I mean, I have not been training with her so much at the academy.  We've been meeting here, and, yeah, she been working with this guy now for three weeks, which I think help her a lot.  And, I mean, it's very hard to say, you know, battle between the coaches.  It has nothing to do.  I mean it's just players and the coaches.  They help us a lot outside.  Her coach is my coach.",Your forehand is the weakest part of her game.  How was it today?,"Not lately, she been improving her forehand a lot.  And I knew I had to do it differently today.  I know that her forehand is improved, because to work in Spain, first thing they do is work on your forehand.  And it was much better.",Yes,UNK, 
218,334,1191,What do you do if you don't play tennis?,We don't know. We'll see what that kinesiology does for me.,"Seriously, do you have a backup plan?","I try not to think about that. I don't know how close I want to be to doing that yet. We'll try to milk this as long as I can, the 30 grand.",A lot of guys go to college and stop after a year or two years. You stayed four; got your degree. Was there ever a point in your time there where you thought about leaving?,"Um, there were good -- after the first year I got to the finals, NCAA's my first year, and they were kind of strong on that one. You get older, and they kind of tend to weaken the deal to go play. Actually, they offered me a coach and offered me some help and expenses to play and travel, but I just -- I loved college too much. I just -- I didn't want to let the team down. Just had too much fun, and I was playing well, and I wanted to finish out and get my degree because you never know what's going to happen with tennis. One ankle injury, you're done.","When you say that, you're talking about like an agency?","No, well just the USTA, majors, whoever. Doesn't really matter who, but there were some offers, and I didn't -- I wasn't ready. Just wasn't ready to travel by myself for that long every week, different city. Just wasn't ready.",Any concern keeping the nerves in check? You have a day or two to think about this heading into the next round.,"No, I think if I got through that one I'll be all right. That was the seed. I got my first ATP win, so I can't go backwards.",No,Yes, 
138,7052,25736,"Early in the tournament when you were asked about the big four, you said you thought it was just around the corner when the young guys would be breaking through and winning majors. With what's happened yesterday with Rafa and today with Andy, what are your thoughts on that timetable and about the young guys breaking through?","Oh, as I said, it was around the corner. I didn't know it was that around the corner. But, yeah, I mean, what can I say? We want to win. I mean, I think the younger guys, we want to come on that stage. We strive for this. I think we're thirsty for that. We want to prove ourselves. We also want to prove to the big guys that we're around the corner, as I mentioned. But, again, it's just a different stage for us at that point. But we need to establish ourselves I think even better, just what we're doing right now. It's a good effort, but you got to do that almost every single tournament you play on. This is where it shows. If you're sustainable to get out those top four guys and eventually put yourself in that position.",You used the term 'focus.' How is that different today than any other match considering the importance and how you did it against the defending champ? Was it extra special today?,"Yeah, I think in those moments you are ready to face what you have to face. I think early in the tournament you always have a little extra tension and you know that anything can happen. But I think as soon as you get into that phase of that second week, you know, your dimension, your vision is changing a little bit. I felt that I've raised my level a little bit on and off the court. Off the court is my focus. My ability to switch when I really have to go another gear. And today I knew I was ready to play. So to me, in my mind, I was really calm and I knew what I had to do. I think I was composed and as calm as possible on the court. The good thing is I played a match already on the Centre Court, so that gave me an extra edge. But, you know, there's nothing extraordinary, if I may say so.",During the match Andy was overheard complaining about something that should have apparently happened five minutes before. Are you aware of anything that happened five minutes before?,The match?,Were you brought on quickly perhaps after the women's game?,I have no idea. Sorry.,"Talking about young guys or girls going far in the competition, Maria Sharapova won 10 years ago when she was 17. What kind of tips are you getting from her?","Well, tips? She says, Win it (smiling). What can I say? I think that's a good tip.",UNK,UNK, 
62,18688,67969,She had some lovely downtheline forehands and backhands. She wasn't missing too many of those.,"I mean, she's hit some unbelievable shots where, you know, it skimmed this far over the net and hits the corners and then missed. I think that was one thing I did know going into the match, and I thought if I get a hit on the ball I have obviously got to play aggressive and my style and be moving forward. But if not, try and hang in there, because she tended to hit three, maybe four good ones and either going to be a winner or error. She came up with the goods when it counted.",Probably go match to match like everybody does. You're probably aware that Li Na is in your top section. Will you watch a little bit of her match?,I'm not thinking about Li Na at all at the moment. I don't know who won that next match or if they have even played next for my second round. That is absolutely in the forefront of my mind at the moment rather than anything else further down the track.,"Your prospective match, your second round, does someone have a look at that match for you?","My coach will have a look. And depending who it is, we know one of the players very well and one I don't know at all. So I'm sure Dave's out there either watching it or will watch it, you know, before I play, and we can come up with something.",What do you have to do better than you did in Brisbane and Sydney?,"Oh, I haven't even thought about it. You're putting me on the spot. (Laughter.) Look, I think there is a few things I can do better, like keep serving well. I wasn't too happy with my return last week in Sydney, and overall I think just probably need to play a little bit better. I mean, we have had some pretty close matches in the past, and last week is certainly going to be a good one to look back on and maybe watch again and see what I did, you know, well and what I didn't do well. I think at the end of the day it's going to be my game, and I've got to focus on that.","Sounds like you have a cold, a little nasally. A bit of pollen on the court?",I have had it for a few days and my voice is still a little bit croaky today.,Yes,Yes, 
135,752,2741,"Were you surprised by how kind of flat Roger seemed to be after the medical timeout? After just coming out the rest of the match, it seemed like he was missing a little bit more than he was before.","I don't like to see it that way. I like to see I went for my shots and I made winners. If you see those two games, I was really aggressive on my return, and I just went for the shots. I didn't want to go for longer, for long rallies, because I felt a little bit stiff right after the treatment. So I honestly don't think that he was that flat. Again, I know the feeling, you know, it's not nice to sit there for three minutes and to wait for somebody, but it's part of it, what can I do?",I think you said on court it was the best win of your career. Why would you say that?,"Probably the most important, especially because it was five sets, you know, because I had I beat him before, but it was a threeset match, you know. So for my confidence and just for me as a tennis player, a fiveset win over Roger Federer, it's really big.",How important was the end of the second set? Do you think that was the key to the match?,"There I was lucky, I have to say. I was really lucky then. In the second set he had a smash and I guess the place, the place where he could  I don't know, I guess I just didn't move a lot. I stayed in one place. He smashed right onto me. So, yeah, that was a bit lucky.",Is it difficult to play against someone with the support of the crowd?,"Yes, it is. It is. But the crowd wasn't that bad. Of course, if you play Roger wherever in the world, you know, the crowd is going to be against you. That's just what you have to take. I know how Paris crowd can get, you know, but I just didn't I was trying not to show too much emotion except one broken racquet, but one is nothing for me (laughter). So I tried not to give them too much things to whistle about or to yeah, that was important for me was in the fifth set to get an early break, because if it would get tight, you know, the crowd can push you down.","You're very confident going into the match. You have said things in the past that got people a little bit riled up and bent out of shape. Are you gratified you can come through with a big win like this and sort of justify a lot of your outspoken, freewheeling comments?","I didn't understand two words, ""gratify"" and ""justify."" My English is not...",UNK,Yes, 
128,18072,65616,Of this tournament.,"I think so. I think so. I mean, if it's a match like this, it's fine. I think it's still enough tennis for the people. I think it's exciting. We had the whole scenario today in today's match. But if I would have served it out, it would have been over in a hurry. I think I almost felt the spectators weren't quite ready for it to end quite yet, although many would have been happy for me, they would have loved to see more tennis. I remember sitting in a room in Shanghai where players were asked, Would you like it to be five sets or three sets, the yearend final? Kind of went in a circle. Everyone said bestofthree sets. I was the only guy that said, I think we should have bestoffive sets. Okay, let's make it bestofthree sets. I don't care. I do care actually. I think it makes for a great year end. Sure, you can see why maybe it's healthier to play bestofthree sets. Maybe the yearend could be a bestoffive set match. I do believe that, yeah.","The season is now over for you, but there is still a Davis Cup final ahead next week. What is your feeling for this final? Do you think that Spain is the overwhelming favorite? Do you see any chance for Argentina?","I'm sure it's an open match in some ways. But I think that Spain is the favorite. Are they the overwhelming favorite? I don't think it matters. They are the favorites. They're playing at home. They have an incredibly solid team. But then again, the Argentinians, they have their players and their team, as well. If a surprise happens, anything's possible. Obviously it's normal to favor the Spaniards with Rafa on the team back on clay. It's logical.","With so many titles and records in the bag, how do you assess your hunger and desire? Has it dipped at all? Is it stronger than ever?","It's normal really. I don't go through phases where I feel like I want to play 10 more years and then only six more months. I always look ahead one and a half to two years, and that's still the same right now. Then as time goes by, you know, you see how the body is. I love this game more than anybody, so I'm not all of a sudden going to wake up in the morning and say I don't like it anymore. It's a lot of sacrifice. It's a lot of effort I have to put in every day. I know that. But I do enjoy that because what I get in return is moments like I got today, with my team, with my family. It's priceless really. So for this reason I'm very excited for next year. I am happy that the season is over because it has been long, it has been grueling. But, yeah, I'm very happy and upbeat about what's to come.", , , , ,No,No, 
278,12999,47421,"Hear him? He was yelling quite a bit, which is unusual for him, you know, in frustration. You were making him do that.","Yeah, I heard it, but I did it, too, so... I think it was quite tough for both of us. There was a lot of wind in stadium, and the wind is going around all the time, so it wasn't easy at times. I think the level was not that high and also my level was not that high. Wasn't that spectacular, but some days you have to deal that, and I think we both dealt pretty good with it.",Was there anything he did or didn't do that surprised you?,"No, not really. I mean -- he challenge a lot. That was surprising, because sometimes I thought I was pretty sure that the ball was out but he still challenged. No, I mean, nothing major. I mean, I wasn't surprised. Everybody know what level he can play. So I knew that sometimes you have to play an extra shot, and I was ready for that. But I wasn't surprised at all.",Is he playing the level that he can play at?,"I don't know. To be honest, like I said, it was tough conditions out there today. I don't think both of us played the greatest match, but what he did well was at important moments and the two breakers, every time he came up with a good shot, made a good passing shot. I came to the net I didn't feel like I did anything wrong but he just came up with a better shot.","This run here, what do you think this will do for you going forward?","Well, I hope -- I think now after the tournament I'm going to take a few days off and think about what I did, and I think I'm going to gain a lot of confidence from that. I hope I can stay focussed and work hard and do well in my next tournaments.","Even though it may be difficult to reflect, how will you look back on this incredible run that you've had here?",If it's going to be difficult?,UNK,UNK, 
232,10412,37932, , ,"After what happened last night with Rafa, any point where you thought, Oh, no?","Yeah, not really. I was trying to focus from the start of my match. Obviously I had a lot of chances in the opening set. But being aware of his qualities and experience, I wasn't too surprised with the way he played in important moments. He was mentally very composed. You know, he was out there to win a match. I was a set down, but managed to make the crucial break in the opening game of the second set, and then I thought I played really well.",Did you see Rafa's match last night? What was your reaction to it?,"Well, look, you know, there is not much to say about that match aside of the fact that Rosol played incredible match. There's not much you can do. I don't think Rafa played that bad. You know, just Rosol came up with incredible serves, very aggressive shots. He was taking his chances. You know, you have those days when your opponents have really nothing to lose and they're going for all the shots. So congratulations to him. It's been an incredible match. Everybody thought maybe he's going to have some ups and downs probably in the fifth set, but he proved everybody wrong. That's what happens. I mean, everybody plays tennis nowadays. Even though somebody is ranked 100 places lower than you are, on a given day, especially on the grass, if somebody serves that big, anything can happen.",Did you watch any of it?,I did.,"If you were in Rafa's shoes and the roof was closed  he complained about this  how do you feel about the policy that it takes 35, 40 minutes to get squared away again?","It's hard to judge because there are rules that have been there for years. It's not on us to decide if the roof is going to be open or closed. From a players' perspective, I think it's really important that people from organization and everybody take the opinion of the player very seriously, you know. It's really hard to say. I mean, Rafa knew what's best for him. Obviously it distracted him a little bit because he was playing well in that fourth set. But that's what happens. These are the conditions. You cannot affect the weather. Today we got to the court, they closed the roof, and then we saw sunshine and clear blue sky. But the rule is you cannot open the roof when it is closed. That's what I was said. I thought I played well under these conditions. The last two matches I've played under the closed roof.",UNK,Yes, 
70,15275,55265,Do you have a preference whether it's a day or night match?,"Not really. You know, I don't think the guys are going to have a problem with the heat. I think he has a great five-set record. He's tough and never has any really physical problems. I have no preferences.","Still seems a bit strange when you said ""former champion like me.""",Former No.1 I said.,Former No.1. Does that seem a little bit strange?,For both of us. I didn't say former champion. I said former Grand Slam champion and former No.1.,I misspoke.,Exactly.,"Does that still seem a little bit strange, to use the word ""former""?","That's the way it is. It's a fact, right? I was a very proud man for a long time and still today about the record. Today Rafa deserves it because he's hung in there for a long time. He could have lost his No.2 position for a long time against Djokovic, so he deserves it. It's fine.",UNK,Yes, 
260,5114,18800,Okay. What are your thoughts on the match?,"I thought I played pretty well. You know, I thought she played extremely well. She's definitely suited to the grass courts. She served really highpercentage first serves towards the end of both sets, so it was really tough for me to get into her service games. But in general, you know, I thought I competed well, and there are still lots of things that can be improved, but in terms of where I was a few months ago, I think it's a big improvement already.",Do you think you're closing the gap on these people now?,"Well, yeah. You know, I've always thought that I could beat these girls, but, you know, you definitely have to bring my A game. I have to be really mentally ready for it. Today, you know, I thought everything was good. Just a few sloppy points here and there where she took advantage, you know. When she broke at the end of the second set, I just missed a few first serves and she took advantage of that.","If you think back a couple of years, and you had expectations then, do you think you've achieved those expectations or not reached them or exceeded them?","I can't even remember what my expectations were a few years ago. All I have been trying to do for the last few months is work on movement, work on my serve. I think both things are improving. You know, I'm not really saying, Oh, I want to be top 50 by the end of the year, whatever. I'm just trying to stay injuryfree for the moment and work as hard as I can.","This is a sport where you have to try and be patient and take your time with things. Are you a patient person, or are you wanting to get so ahead quickly and as a result maybe all those results that you might have wanted or people expect of you are not necessarily coming as frequently or as fast as you'd like?","I think I'm a really patient person. I take after my dad in that regard. But, you know, you're talking about everyone else's expectations. I said yesterday that I'm really not focused on any of that. You know, I'm just trying to do my own thing. I'm happy with how things are going at the moment.","Going into Wimbledon next week, looks like you'll be in top 100. It's disappointing today to lose, obviously, but it must be quite nice for you to know you've achieved that goal.","Yeah, definitely. You know, I'm feeling really confident in my game at the moment, so going into Wimbledon, I'm going to be really pumped for my match there obviously. But I've still got quarters in doubles here with Heather here tomorrow.",UNK,UNK, 
64,6977,25481, , , , ,"Pretty important to win that off her set points, wasn't it?","Well, definitely. It's always nice to be a set up. You know, I don't know, I just kept fighting. I actually just had a good feeling going into the match, even though I started off a little bit slower today. She started off well, and, you know, I made a few mistakes. But then I actually felt like I started to hit the ball really well. I was thinking, Okay, if she wins this match, it's just too good, because I'm starting to feel this right now. I have a feeling this is going to be a long one.",How much of a help to you is your father when he comes on court?,"Well, of course it helps a little bit sometimes. You know, he just gives me the encouragement. Today he just told me that I was playing well, and keep continuing the way you're playing and stay close to the baseline.","Did he, because you asked for him early, didn't you, after you played poorly at the start?","Yeah, but he just kept encouraging me. He said, No worries. You just made a few mistakes that wasn't necessary, but just keep your feet moving. I mean, you're doing the right thing.",Yes,Yes, 
44,5302,19489,We saw you blow a kiss there. Who was that to?,"That was actually the owner of the Johnny Rockets. He helped me out really big when I was a junior, when I was 17 years old. He gave me some money to travel to Kalamazoo. I won that and I turned pro. So he was a special guy in my life.",When did you move to the States?,When I was 11.,To Miami?,To Miami.,That's a lot of free burgers and shakes.,"Yeah, I actually -- yeah. (Laughter.) I had to hit with him, which wasn't that bad, either, but he sponsored me for a while. Then once I turned pro I started taking care of myself. He was a huge help.",Do you feel like then this is a homecoming for you?,"Oh, definitely. You know, my mom lives here. My brother lives here. We tried to come down as much as possible with my fiance and my little one. You know, I grew up on these courts when the USTA was here. We had Jay Berger, Patrick McEnroe, all of these on the Stadium Court. I came on Thursday before the quallies. I hit here, and just it's an amazing city, amazing town, amazing place to be back at. Um, I think we might be moving back here hopefully the end of the year. The winters are tough in Jersey.",Yes,Yes, 
224,11189,40729,"You say the Australian Open final.  Was your game plan the same for this match, or did you modify at all?","I tried to play offensive.  Tried to take away the net from him.  And that worked very well, you know, basically all the way through.  I couldn't play that aggressive anymore in the second and third set because of his serving.  You know, he's serving much better. That's usually what matters most with his game.  I think he doesn't know that sometimes, but he really starts to hit the lines much better and he gets much more free points.  Obviously, once he starts drilling with the forehand it's hard to get, you know, the upper hand again. So I couldn't really do that anymore.  But that's usually how I win matches against him, is by scrambling and staying in there and everything.  Just today it didn't go my way.  It went his way. It's tough.  Because I think, like I said, it was an okay match for me.  And I don't know the stats, but I really felt like I had the upper hand almost all the way through.",Was there some issue with the challenges after the second set?  You seemed pretty unhappy with something.  Or was that the frustration at the way the tiebreak went?,"I could explain you, but it's no problem.  It was not much of a big deal.  I just asked to challenge it.  I had to ask him five times till my request was granted, which I thought was a bit ridiculous.",Do you have any physical problems with the third set?,Wish I had.  Wish I had an excuse (laughter).,So you didn't have any physical problem?,"Yeah, I'm at a hundred percent (smiling).",Last week we saw you in the coffee promotion and the Gillette promotion shaving.  Do you sometimes worry about your sponsorship commitments making you lose concentration about tournaments?  How do you keep them balanced?,"I mean, it's definitely part of my life today, you know.  I've been doing it for many years now.  Honestly, I try to limit it as much as I can, you know.  But I have great partners and great sponsors.  I'm very thankful to them. No, I mean, I schedule those that they don't affect my play.  Why should they?  Shaving with a thousand guys is okay.  It's not like it's energy consuming, you know.  Maybe for them because it was the first time.  For me anyway it was a fun thing. It's fun to get out of the hotel and just do something else.  So, no, it doesn't affect me.  Might have done in the past where I maybe even put more time into the media and the press.  Now I cut it down to bare minimum, which helps my game actually.",No,No, 
156,7332,26816,Cilic has had a lot of long matches. You haven't. Is that going to be a factor?,"I don't know. You know, obviously I feel fresh. I don't know how he feels. From my side, I feel good physically. That's not gonna be an issue for me in the match. I don't know how he's feeling.",You looked really focused when you went out there today. Is there a feeling now with you that you feel like you belong in these big games at Grand Slams?,"Uhm, I think like after the US Open in 2008, when I reached the final there, won against Rafa and Del Potro, you know, that was really when I started to feel like, you know, I could compete at the very highest level of the game. I'd worked really hard physically after I lost to Rafa at Wimbledon that year because I realized, you know, I needed to. But, yeah, I think definitely now I'm ready to win a Grand Slam, and hopefully I can do it here.",There were three crucial points where you decided to serve and volley for the first time in the match. What was the thought process? Why did you suddenly decide to serve and volley then? You were under pressure. Can you think what you were thinking at that time?,"Well, I mean, when I played against him in the past, I have serve-volleyed against him. It can work well. But it's important to, you know, use it as I guess more sort of as a surprise tactic when he's not really expecting it. I don't know exactly when that was. I'm not sure exactly when you're talking about. But the serve-volley did work really well today.",You talked about revenge on court. Does it bother you that you weren't able to produce your tennis that day and he was the guy on the other side of the net?,"No. I was obviously disappointed about what happened there. I had to take a pretty long break afterwards. You know, I was feeling good going into the US Open. You know, wasn't the way I would have liked to have lost. But, no, I mean, everyone talks about that a lot, about revenge and stuff. But, you know, you just go out there and every day's a different day in tennis. I think that I can win the match. Regardless of what happened at the US Open, if I play well, focus hard and concentrate, then there's no reason why I can't beat him again.","When you talk with your team after a win like tonight, do you smile more? Do you have a voice which sounds more happy than now? Now you talk almost like you lost.","Have you ever sat in this seat before? I mean, last year I played 80 odd matches and we do a press conference after every single match. We do one before every tournament. More for other bits and pieces.",Yes,Yes, 
40,17169,62131,"Speaking of shirts, your choice of color has been generating a lot of buzz for some reason. Do you get to choose what you wear, or does Nike choose to put both you and Rafa in pink this week?","I think it was a coincidence that we're both in pink. I didn't even know he was going to be playing in pink, because we kind of decide the colors we are going to play probably over a year ahead. I don't know where my head was when I chose pink, but I like it, you know (laughter). Honestly I've gotten a lot of praise for it, you know. People apparently like it, you know. So that's a good thing. It's only for, unfortunately or luckily, only for two tournaments because I'm going to be changing again for the Open, and I thought it was going to be something fun for the summer. That's kind of how it goes. No, I have a huge impact and input on what I'm going to wear. One time I think I was supposed to wear something yellow. I forgot that I said yes to it. I asked them if I couldn't just change it and play in the old shirt, so that's happened before. Now I'm much more on top of it from my side, especially, knowing when the deadlines are and when to choose the colors and if it's a shirt or a T-shirt. We work very closely with Nike. It's a lot of fun, and they're great.","You talked about having a fun match and some kind of fun shots. One that jumped out to me, it was like a half volley in the game that you won -- you went up 4-3. Do you know the shot I'm talking about? It was a half volley over the net and it kind of spun back and looked like it hit your opponent in the face almost with -- there was so much spin on it.",I don't remember it.,You don't remember the shot? It was a good shot.,"Anyway, it was a good one? Perfect. No, but like you say, I think there were some good ones out there, some unusual shots, you know, like the lob, the passing shots, the little flick stuff. You have to come up with -- I remember that's how I played the whole time, coming up, and then I had to improve so much on my baseline game because all the guys leading the rankings sort of like Ferrero and Nalbandian and Hewitt and Safin and Roddick even, I mean, they were all playing from the baseline. This is when I realized I also have to be more patient and not just approach on anything, because they were not coming in anymore. You have to maneuver the opponents around a bit more and be smart about it. So it was a really fun match. I enjoyed it.","What are you looking to change -- I guess your next opponent, Tomas Berdych, you lost to him the last few times out.","Yeah, I definitely have to go back, and, you know, think what didn't go so well against him and what did work well. He's definitely on the run right now, so hope to stop him a bit. He played great in Paris, at Wimbledon, and also, he beat me in Miami in a tough three-setter where I had match point, so that was a bit of a pity, obviously. So I hope to learn from those mistakes and come up with a good game plan tomorrow.","You talked about how the game has changed in terms of the style. Llodra, you used to see a lot more of those guys. What about the depth? You see at an event like this, you don't have a Tsonga or Del Potro, and Roddick is not here, and yet there seems to be match after match -- the depth, do you notice a change over the past decade?","Well, what I see is that guys are serving harder in general, you know. Everybody's clocking the 200 quite comfortably today. Before, 200 used to be a big serve. Today it's kind of the norm. Second serves, you know, we used to have a lot of guys serving 130s, 150s before. Now everybody is around 150, 160, 170, and that kind of neutralizes the point a bit more from the start. I think also guys maybe return a bit better but then again maybe don't volley as well, so there's not much of those pressure plays like we used to have. Match is played on a couple shots here and there like we see indoors or on grass sometimes. Those you had much more in any surface, you know. So I don't know if it's harder or not, but I definitely think the depth is big. Guys are hitting the ball bigger than ever. I think the string has been a huge change in how the guys are playing these days. Before, I remember you could hit hard and long. Today you can even hit hard and short cross, which is incredible, you know, the angles we can get when we hit the ball. And I think that's been the biggest change is that you can just go from hitting long to hitting short cross all of a sudden with the same amount the space, and that's something that was not possible with sort of the all-gut string before when I was coming up.",No,Yes,"negated question, he remembers it"
123,16106,58410,"How would you assess the first two months of this year, for you, and how significant is this title in the context of those first two months?","It's a very important title. I had not started the year the way I may be wanted it and the way maybe the people expecting me to. I made some major changes; racquet, which was -- which was quite risky at this time. But, look, I take my responsibility and that's what I did, so I just have to move on. And as the season is going on, I feel more comfortable with the racquet and I feel comfortable on the court more. I try to release the pressure that I have and just play the tennis that I played in the first part of the 2008, and if I do so, I think I will be pretty successful.","This is your first tournament victory of 2009, and your next tournament, you're going to be the defending champion at Indian Wells. This must give you some confidence going into that event.","Certainly. It certainly does. I had to come here to play, get some matches outdoor before going to Indian Wells. I am aware of the fact that I will have a very difficult time, going to Davis Cup, play on clay, which really doesn't go on my favor for Indian Wells. But, look, that's the sport, and representing the country is something special. So playing the Davis Cup, and then hopefully I can get ready for Indian Wells.","Considering that there are a lot of injuries to the top players, do you feel the field is going to be the same?","I'm trying not to think about that, because usually, you know, the people say if you think about negative things, negative things come to you. I try to stay positive and not pay attention too much on the injuries and the schedule; that it's really, really tight and tough for me, and for the other players, of course, who are playing Davis Cup in the next couple of months in Europe on clay. It's never easy physically and mentally. But, you know, I just have to get used to it and try to hold on, stay healthy.","You said that you were getting criticism after the Australian Open, a few days back in the press conference; do you think you are now trying to prove something to everyone?","No, I am not proving anything to anyone. Believe me, everybody has a right to his own opinion, and everybody has a right to say what they want to say. Of course, there are critics on my game and there are critics on everybody's game. It's not possible that everybody likes you. But I'm just trying to stay focused on the right path and that's it. You know, work hard, and the results will come.","After this win, how far off your top form do you think you now are?","Well, I've played two great matches, I think today, and in the quarterfinals, as well. Semifinals, really big struggle for me and make it a lot hard, but I think with the fight, I managed to stay in that match and win. But overall, I think it was quite a good tournament for me, which, of course, gives me a lot much confidence for the upcoming events and continuation of the season. I can't actually rate my numbers where I stand now with my form, but certainly, I feel confident and I barely wait for another event.",UNK,UNK, 
225,21938,79715,What is there in your grass court arsenal that you've yet to use this week?,"I haven't served and volleyed a whole lot. I haven't been to the net much. I think if you hit it hard and clean, flat and long, it's hard to come in really. I think you're able to neutralize your opponent. Today Nalbandian, that's the kind of stuff he does. It's kind of hard to find your way into your net if you don't follow after the return or the serve. But important is that I'm moving well, I'm using basically everything of my arsenal, the slice, you know, the drive and so forth. I've been playing really well. I've gotten through the matches comfortably and that's very nice.",You've not dropped a set yet.,"Yeah, I mean, it doesn't really matter. At the end of the day I know other people care more about that kind of stuff. As long as I find my way into the second week, like last year, too, right away, I'm happy. I hope I can always step it up so when Monday comes around, now the tougher and tougher matches come in, even though today I thought was already very difficult.","When you were in the middle of your five titles on the trot, I can remember you talking about the feeling of coming here, feeling like you owned the place, like it was your court. Does it still feel like that?","Uhm, I never really felt it was that way. I don't think I ever said that. I always just feel very good here, around the grounds, on the court. Obviously the more you win, the more confidence you get. Then again, I've learned my lesson early on in my career where I used to underestimate opponents because of the way they played, the way their techniques worked out, or just said against this guy, I can't lose on grass. Next thing you know, that's what happens. This is where you have to be very, very, you know, sort of mentally strong. I think with the success I've had here, obviously I always come in with somewhat of a pressure. But, as well, I think this is where I'm able to shift up a couple gears on grass because it works to my strengths the way I can play here.",Do you feel you have a gear or two to shift through still next week?,"No, I'm very happy if I keep playing this way. So it's a matter of keeping it up and then, you know, adjusting to what's coming from the opponents. They all play very differently. Nobody plays like Nalbandian. So I don't even know who I play next round. Still have to find out first.","You may be tired of answering this question, but fans are really interested in comparing the generations. Rafa just said that he felt of the current generation, the top four were more solid, they did better both at reaching the finals at slams and the Masters, the smaller tournaments, that they did really well on all surfaces. Could you take that a little further and compare maybe the play of your generation compared to the Andre and Pete generation?","Uhm, what do you want me to say? Well, I think it's not fair to say that our generation is stronger. For many years many people said it's weaker just because there was only me and then there was only Rafa and me. And now all of a sudden there's people talking about four. Now it's the best ever. This is where I disagree. It doesn't happen so quickly. I remember when Pete and Andre and Becker and Edberg and McEnroe and all those guys were still around, and more even. I think it was very good already. Before that generation was also very strong. It's just a matter that Rafa and myself, we took a lot of the Grand Slams and we didn't allow anybody else to shine really. For that reason, all the other players didn't get the respect they deserve. That's just to straighten that record a little bit. Now I still feel 10, 20 years ago, I still think when they were doing something good, they were doing excellent. Like Pete's serve, I still think it will be one of the great serves in the game today if not the best one. Agassi maybe didn't have the serve, but he had the return that many players don't have today. Maybe they had some other weaknesses in their games, but maybe they were able to eliminate those with their great strengths. This is maybe where today we're more overall because I guess we have to, because the conditions have slowed down, and that allows us to maybe win the French Open and Wimbledon back to back a bit more easier today than back in the day where you had grass court specialists, hard court specialists, indoor specialists, clay court specialists. Today everybody can play everywhere. That's the way the game has evolved and we're adjusting to it.",No,No, 
153,1855,6694,"That was pretty straightforward for you, was it? Did you feel in control from start to finish?","Singles? Yeah, yeah. I mean, I played him earlier this summer in L.A. and he definitely took care of me there. I think I lost like 31. Today I had a little bit different game plan coming in. Felt different from the start and I think it showed.",What did you change?,"In L.A. I was pretty impatient, playing too risky. He obviously doesn't miss very much. He gets a lot of balls back, grinds a lot. Today I was a little more patient waiting for the right ball to attack, be aggressive, and I think it worked out pretty well.","A lot of tennis players in Nebraska, or are you about it?",Me and Andy a long time ago when he was in Omaha.,You were in Kansas from when?,Starting in fifth grade. I was in fifth grade in Kansas City.,In Overland Park?,Yeah.,Yes,UNK,confused
23,13435,48933,What did you tell yourself when Novak was serving for the match at 54 that helped you break him?,"Well, I think important was actually to stay with him whenever I got the break, because normally then Novak has a tendency to sort of just run away with it, or you have tendency to maybe play a little bit more too freely and make mistakes or too passive, and then he takes big cuts at the ball. But I was able to just keep the pressure on Novak and show him that if he slips up, I will be there and I will make it a very competitive match in the end for him. That's exactly what happened. So I think it came more from there than actually the game itself. Even though I did explain I think I was with the wind, which was a little bit helpful, as well.","Rafa went down pretty early in the tournament. Murray lost to Raonic; Stan lost. All the talk was, it's sort of a dawning of a new day; the locker room is changing. Yet what happened in the end? Two champions, two old champions emerge. What's your thought about the state of the game in that context?","I think it's good. You know, it's good the way it is. It's unfortunate we had a few injuries around. Del Po, Ferrer now. I mean, Murray is coming back. He's not injured anymore, which is good. He's been playing a lot of tennis this year, the most of any player, which is slightly surprising, you know, knowing that he has had back surgery. That's his way of dealing with it right now is playing a lot. And maybe  who knows  maybe he will slow down a bit on the clay or eventually he will figure things out. But, you know, I think I'm not going to analyze every single young player that's coming up, you know. But definitely, you know, thanks to their higher seedings now getting deeper in tournaments automatically now, and now it's just a question, can they upset once in a while the big guys and, you know, not lose against lowerranked players, which is always inevitably going to happen. Is always a tough thing to avoid happening. But consistency is what it's about now for them, you know, just going deep. I think obviously Novak and Rafa and all these guys won't have a stranglehold at the top. I'm moving up that direction, as well. That's very encouraging for me as well personally. I'm just happy I'm playing well again.",But a new age hasn't exactly arrived?,"Well, you guys know best, so don't ask me. (Smiling).",You're the man now.,But you guys make your own opinions  very quickly sometimes.,"You were very complimentary about the tournament, but what do the kids and Mirka like to do around them? What do they like around Indian Wells?","It's like blue skies every day. When you're a parent it's a whole lot easier when you're not fighting the rain. That's our point. It's that indoor/outdoor feeling, which is great. You know, you can go for  just go outside and go do anything. Catch up with other kids, you know, jump in the pool the whole time, that kind of thing. Draw with chalk on the ground, you name it. I'm not going to explain how to do that. I'm trying hard myself already. We enjoy it here.",UNK,UNK, 
230,20311,73781,And she had serve for 5-0?,Yeah.,"In the third were you down, too?","She was up 3-1 and serving, yeah.","You returned very well, and yet Wickmayer is known for having a rather difficult serve. Was it quite easy to read today?","Um, yeah. Well, honestly, sometimes she was serving at the same place or just body to me, so... Or I think she was just kicking the serve mostly. Like she wasn't really going for ace or something like this, so it was pretty tough to return. But I don't know, it just worked well today.","When you have a run like this of win after win, is there something you feel in your game that you can put your finger on that explains the wins, or is it just the way the games come?","I don't know. You know, every match is different. Every match I play a little bit different. It depends on the opponent. Yesterday I guess I was just lucky a little bit maybe in the third set, because she was, you know, always up in the score in the third set and she had so many chances to break me. You know, I just tried to stay there, so...","Wickmayer seemed to be getting very angry with herself during the match. Do you notice those things when you're playing, and how do you deal with that?","Well, I've known her for quite a long time, and we're pretty good friends also. She's very emotional. She always used to be like this. So it doesn't mean if it's nervous that she's gonna give me the match. I just try not to think about it and try to focus on my game.",Yes,UNK, 
226,13550,49293,"What do you know about your semifinal opponent? Must be rather a surprise that you're not playing Venus, that you're playing Pironkova.","You know, obviously Venus is going to be always one of the favorite players here at Wimbledon. But if Tsvetana beat her today, she deserves to be in the semifinals. She played great tennis. I played her in Moscow last year and I lost to her. I will try to remember that match. I know I was not playing my best tennis over there. I will just have to, you know, think about it a little bit and prepare myself the best I can. I'm gonna try my best over there, just the way I was trying today, and then we will see what's going to happen.",What were her strengths when you played her in Moscow?,"I think she's all-over-the-court player. You know, it's hard to predict what she's doing on the court. Sometimes she can slice; sometimes she can hit the ball; sometimes she can play slow; sometimes she can play fast. You never know what to expect, so you lose your rhythm. Then you start thinking maybe too much on the court. I just know that in that match I will have to concentrate on myself and execute my game no matter what the score, no matter what she's trying to do. Just try not to look on the other side and try to concentrate on myself.","You had some really strong results a while back in your career, then there were some tough results and your injury. What was it like when you were really struggling, trying to get over your injury? Did you imagine relatively quickly you'd reach the Wimbledon semifinal?","Well, you always dream about it. You always want to be there. Like I always say, I always believe in myself and I believe I can be here. But obviously when you go through a lot of injuries in your career, it sort of puts a lot of doubts in your head. It is very difficult to come back after an injury. You lose a lot of confidence. But, uhm, I think, I don't know, I always believed in myself. I always believed I could do it. I was just maybe frustrated that my injuries are not going away. But I know as soon as I feel hundred percent, I will be able to play good tennis again. It's just matter of time. Because I can work hard. I can work hard every day. I believe that, you know, if you work hard, you will achieve.",This was your first victory against Kim Clijsters today. What made the difference today?,"Uhm, I think I was able to play one point at a time today. I was able to keep my concentration from the beginning till the end of the match. Also I'm much more experienced right now, much more mature. I think I played tactically better, and I was able to hang in there, not to pay attention to what was going on around. Even after I lost the first set, maybe there were a couple unforced errors that could have put me back, but I was trying not to think about it. I was trying to think about what I have to do next to win the next point. I think it helped me a lot.","You are a promoter of gender equality. What have you achieved, and what are your goals with that job?","It is very important to give the same opportunities to everyone in the world. If we are lucky here, in Russia, there are so many countries, where girls, they don't have the possibilities to achieve their dreams. And I think, uhm, us tennis players, we could be role models for the girls. No matter what they want to do in their lives, they should believe in themselves. They should believe they can achieve great things. It's not more about of gender equality, it's more about equality for opportunities for everybody, so everyone has the same opportunities. I think our examples, where we are, we should be able to make, you know, a lot of girls around the world to believe in themselves more.",Yes,Yes, 
81,1472,5363,"You hit a lot of winners, very few errors, and moved very well. Is this your best feeling since coming back from the injury?","I played well, no? But in Cincinnati I did well a few matches, too. Very happy, no? I practiced one week here before, and I was practicing well. I went to the match and I feeled okay. So very happy to be in second round. Very happy to win against difficult opponent like Richard.",What changes happen to your attitude when you've been hurt and you've been out of play for a while? Do you have to psych yourself up to get back to a winner mentality?,"No, no, no. Seems like I was two years outside of competition. I was two months. I was one month and a half outside the competition, no? That's all. No, I have an injury. That's normal in sport. And then here, back here to try my best another time. So that's all.","Is it in the back of your mind about the knees, or now you don't think about it at all when you're playing?","I don't have pain, so I don't think.","You never had trouble on your serve today. Was that a product of you serving well, or do you think he struggled on the return?","No, I am serving well. I did well in Cincinnati, was serving really well, except last match against Djokovic. But the rest of the matches I was serving really well. I think I'm practicing, playing with good tactic, and positive attitude. That's the important thing right now. Later try to get more rhythm and more confidence winning matches.",Did you lose weight because you haven't trained for two months?,No. No. The same.,No,No, 
39,12415,45199,You famously celebrate your victory by eating the grass. Some climb into the player's box. This year Wimbledon is encouraging players not to climb up on the roof if they win. Should players be free to celebrate as they wish?,"That was also kind of a part of traditional celebrations in all the Grand Slams, especially here in Wimbledon. I can't say it's wrong for the players to go straight to their box after they win the match because I understand the need to share this beautiful moment and victory with your closest ones. Maybe it doesn't look proper for this kind of history and tradition we have in Centre Court in Wimbledon, for the rules, just the general image. But I believe that's also part of sincere emotions that the players show in the end, wanting to celebrate with their closest ones.",Compare with this time last year. Your opening round was entirely straightforward.,"Yes. There are things in my game I would like to improve in a few days and see if I can do better in the next match. I definitely need to gear up for the next match against Tsonga, which is a great challenge, as I was speaking before. But for now everything is going in the right direction. I hope I'll elevate my game as the tournament progresses. If I don't do that, then I'll find myself in a very difficult position.","What about players who need to move to the next level? One of our own players, Heather Watson, has suggested that some of our British players are mollycoddled or perhaps lazy. From where you have battled through in Serbia, do you see it that way? Because of the facilities, the LTA gives them so much money, do you think the English players have it a little bit easier?","There was a lot of talk about the lack of success in British tennis, having Wimbledon, having LTA as a very successful organization who has invested over 40 million into the National Tennis Center. Of course they're expecting to produce a new wave of successful players that can compete with top players for major titles. This country has the history of this sport, obviously beginning with this tournament. There is no reason to believe that they would not want to have more global success and players who are able to reach bigger heights. But, again, it's probably a systemic problem or issue that they have to work with, the mental approach of the players. Having the right conditions, having everything in front of you at your availability to use anytime you like is not essential for success at the top level. It's an individual sport. It's quite different from any other team sport. It's important to have the right mental approach, the hunger for success, the proper surroundings, the people who can encourage you who know in which way you should develop and practice daytoday. In my own experience, I could feel everything that I do on a daily basis on and off the court will reflect sooner or later on my success and on my tennis results. It's very complex and very demanding sport in general because you are alone on the court and you cannot rely on anybody else once you are there. It's you against your opponent. It's becoming more and more popular around the world, which makes the competition stronger. But, again, considering the tradition that this country has in this sport, the conditions that they have with their National Tennis Center, I believe sooner or later they will have a certain amount of players, both men and women, who will fight for major titles.",Over the past months you've been a little reluctant to share all the tips and suggestions that Boris has made. He's the best diver in the history of this game. Could you reveal what he's told you already or what you anticipate him telling you about the dive?,"I know you would like to hear a lot about what we talk about in the relationship and so forth. But, you know, I can't talk too much. Those are the kind of instructions I get. But generally where he helps me the most and where I feel the biggest change is from a mental point of view. Obviously it's going to take a little bit of time for us to find the perfect balance and the work that we have will reflect on the court with results. I mean, we already have now couple titles together. We have finals of French Open. It's already starting to build up. I start to feel the effect of his advices and his presence. Of course we are working on certain parts of my game. But there are no major changes, and there will not be any major changes. I will not start serving and volleying because this is not the way I've been brought up or I've been learned to play. I'm a different player than what he was in terms of play. But in terms of mental approach and a couple of other things, I find that we have a lot of things in common. That's where I always look forward to talk with him and to get this necessary experience from him and use it in my own case.",You feel it's helping you and you're trending in the right direction?,"Of course. That's the reason why he's there, because we want to have a success together. We want to come up with a new kind of approach that is going to allow me to grow mentally and of course as a player, and hopefully that can be very soon.",UNK,UNK, 
202,258,888,"You made reference here to the shorter Monte-Carlo final, and obviously shorter finals all around now.  Do you think in a way that could help in the sense that it gives you a better chance of playing Hamburg and getting more matches in?","I think in terms of the guys who played the finals of Monaco and then here this week, I feel that Hamburg is definitely going to get more players this year than last year just because not only is it the best-of-three finals, but also the top eight guys get byes. So that, again, gives you much more air to breathe.  And if you were in the finals in Rome you get two days off for that, so much needed important Wednesday start.  Which, for instance, me and Raf wouldn't have gotten last year.  I think if we had gotten that one we would have played. But of you had to win six matches in seven days or six matches in six days that was just too much to ask for.",I'm sorry if you already answered this.  Is the French Open your absolute No.1 priority this year?,"Well, right now it is.  I mean, can you put it over Wimbledon?  I guess never.  But the French Open is before Wimbledon, thank God, so I can really focus on the French Open. Yeah.  I don't know if that answers your question because I don't know myself I guess.",Were these basically ideal conditions for you on clay today?,"I mean, it's been nice actually for the last month on clay.  We've had a bit tough few days just before Monaco.  I think it was quite windy and rainy and a bit. I remember I lost my rhythm a bit from the baseline there that's why I didn't play so well first up in Monaco.  I think it was well really quick conditions all of a sudden the first day. On the match days they always water the court much less than during the practice times because they had more time to water the court, and also it rained more.  But these conditions were very nice, you know. On court, I mean, Corretja asked me, too.  This was perfect conditions for you?  Honestly quick or slow I don't mind.  I've proved myself in Hamburg in the past.  Every time it's a bit slow I like it too because I get more grip and the ball stays a bit lower.  And if it's nicer it's a bit quicker for me which is obviously an advantage. I think you got to be able to play with all conditions on clay because they change sometimes throughout the match.  So you got to be able to adapt and, I think that's a big plus for me that I can do that.","Do you think it's a bit odd now it's only the Grand Slams and Davis Cup where you got best-of-five-set matches, and virtually the rest of the year playing three sets?  Is that strange in the sport to be playing at a certain level and the rest of the year only three-set matches?","Yeah.  You could think it's a bit odd, but at the same time -- like I think I explained it the other day.  I said it's definitely not so cool for the live audience who's in the stadium and for the two players who are playing that day. I mean, we would love to battle it out for five sets and make a big spectacle for all of us.  Then at the same time we're happy to play best of three.  If you look at an entire season and an entire career you avoid injuries here and there. So what happens is maybe the live fan won't get the great match they were hoping for because it's over before it started, like in Monte-Carlo I felt.  But, you know, I think for the TVs it's just easier to set up.  You don't have.  To block a time for five hours and then tune out the last six minutes of last year's finals.  That would be tragic too. It's easier if it's this way, it seems.  It's a bit of a dilemma both ways.  I guess we're trying it this way and see how to goes.  But I think by having this system now more cities and countries will be able to see the top players instead of maybe like maybe Rome, maybe Monaco, and then Hamburg's going to miss out, or Paris, Bercy will miss out.  I think that will be cut down a little bit by adjusting this problem.", , ,Yes,Yes, 
254,16469,59690,"Matches through qualifying in both Brisbane and here and the rounds here, was that the highest level match you played, that quarterfinal tonight?","Probably, yeah. Yeah. I mean, Simone played most aggressive from all the guys. It was, yeah, pretty high level I think. Mentally it was also tough. So conditions were perfect tonight, apart from yeah, yesterday was pretty tough to play against Pablo Andujar. Even though I played three sets, I think it was much worse tennis than today. Today I felt good on the court and it was pretty nice to play. I enjoyed it tonight and I'm happy that I won.",What is your mindset these days with tennis? Just seems like the last six months or so have been a real whirlwind for you obviously from the ban and then to come back from a very low ranking and now shooting up into the top 100 again. Doing really well.,"Well, I experienced something that most of the guys don't experience. I've been banned, yeah, from playing. When you cannot do something that you love and when you're not doing it for a while you see how much you miss it and love it. Ever since I was a kid I dreamed about this, playing, competing, doing something that I love. I really love playing tennis. So I enjoy on the court much more than I used to. Yeah, it's fun being back. All my life I was looking forward to this. I enjoy it more on the court, as I said. It's more fun and more enjoyment on the court.",Does it make your ambition greater now? You did very well before. Got to No.12 in the world. Are you aiming for the top 10 now?,"I am, I am. That was my goal even before. Now it's definitely also again my goal, to get to the top 10. Even probably more than before I'm really motivated for that. I think I'm working harder than before. Yeah, Jack has been helping me a lot with that. I think it's a lot mental. Mentally I'm stronger in some moments. Yeah, I'm looking forward to the next period. It's been tough coming back from the bottom, from zero, and I think I did it pretty well in a short time. I've been playing only three and a half, four months actually, because November and December were dead. There was no tournaments. I started only end of July. So it was tough period behind me, but I'm looking forward to the next period where I can play in the main draws of the big events. That's where I think I can make some good wins and good points.","You were sort of punished for something you didn't deliberately try to do. Did you ever think, You know what, I'm just going to walk away because I was treated unjustly?","Well, you know, in life anything could happen to anyone. This thing that happened to me, I felt it was unfair. I know me and my coach both know what really went on in that room. I didn't do anything wrong. I just followed the doctor's instructions. That was my mistake. I learned something. It was a life lesson definitely. The start was probably very, very hard. Mentally I was very down. I didn't play for some time at all. For sure it was tough to focus on anything. I mean, I needed some time off from everything. Yeah, it was fun in the start. I did some things that I couldn't do before. I just relaxed and enjoyed the time off. After that I started missing it. I started thinking about tennis and how much I like it and how much I want to get back. That's what pushed me to get back even stronger. So that's the whole thing.",Did you lose any sponsors over it?,"Oh, yeah, I did.",Yes,Yes, 
47,2220,8005,"One thing I had asked is you were sort of a marked man after you got to the final here last year.  People were eager to play you and you said you were the player to beat.  That was the case last year, too, so why can you feel so differently this time?","No, I wasn't the guy to beat last year.","People were looking at playing you more after Australia last year all season, right?","Yeah, all season, but it's a big difference coming here.  It's a big difference.  It's not the same thing as last year.",Because of the points?,"Not the points, but it's a Grand Slam.  You play in the finals, it's much -- way different.  It's different.",Can we just go back to Monfils for a second?  You played him in August last year.  How much has he improved since then?,"Listen, I think at that time he had problems with coaches so he wasn't feeling so good.  I couldn't say.  I mean, every day is different.  I mean, one day we play good, one day we play bad.  One day you're good at important points, one day you're not. He improved.  Today I think he stuck with his coach before this tournament.  He's playing with nothing to lose, and you saw how confident he came on the court and how he's hitting his forehands and how he's running everywhere.  He's very confident, and that's a lot. The tennis he has since two years, he doesn't improve anything amazing in tennis.  It's just the confidence.  It's just the experience.  I think it's good that he found his way, he stuck with his coach and he's feeling very confident now.  That's the difference, I guess.", , ,No,No, 
94,14940,54083,"In brevity, what was your take on that call on match point? It clearly annoyed you.","I mean, that's how it is. This is tennis. That's why we have a HawkEye, and that's actually how he can  you know, how you can judge that the call is late. Didn't affect me when he served like 215 first serve and the linesman call it out. Then Andy was not happy with the call, take a challenge. Actually, I just hit the ball into the net. It was not an ace. I mean, if we look at all the rule books we going to see that if it's not a clear ace there is a repeat of point actually. I have no idea what Mohamed did. As I said, I mean, he is the best referee on tour. I never had anything like that with him. Actually, I was so shocked when he said this one. I mean, yeah, you can be trying serving five match points on his serve, and then when you have a break point and he just give you like this from the back, you know, you don't fight with Andy, but you just get the second from him.",What was Mohamed's explanation to you? How did he justify it?,"He just said that  actually, the call was so late that it didn't affect me. When Andy took a challenge and it shows that it's good, then it's his point, you know.",Are you saying it did affect your return?,"Actually, this is not the point of the problem, you know. The problem is that when the linesman call it out and it's not a clear ace which wasn't. I mean, I just hit the ball into the net because I heard it out, then he cannot give a point to him. Even if he take a challenge and the ball is good. That's why we have a challenge to repeat the point. Because the linesman wasn't right; the challenge show it's good; then should be two points. I have no idea where he find out that it's the point for him. No, I never seen that.",Why didn't you call for the supervisors?,Actually I was asking for it.,They wouldn't let you have it?,"Actually he said that he cannot change it because it is his judge. What can I do? I mean, whatever he says, then he's right. I mean, that's the problem actually. You know, because actually the supervisor should be on court and he should see the situation. Actually, that's why. You know, when the players make a mistake, he has no chance to you know, he get whatever, point penalty, penalty, whatever, fined, everything. But when the referee makes a mistake there is no other excuse. He just said, Yeah, that's how it is. I'm not saying anything wrong against Mohamed. As I said, I never had a better referee than him, but this I was shocked actually.",UNK,UNK, 
233,11246,40981,You're the same age as Maria.  When did you first know her or meet her?,"Good question actually.  I think I saw her on TV when I played juniors and she played main draw of US Open or something.  It was on TV.  I think she beat someone the first round.  I just remember her dress, that's it (smiling).",Why is that?,It was pink dress.  I just remember the color actually.  Sorry.,Do you remember what year that was?,Year?,2002?,I don't really remember.  Sorry., , ,UNK,UNK, 
250,3133,11382,You had played two more matches than David. Do you think that you were a little bit more tired than him?,"Well, it was one match more, not two. I think that, yeah, I had played four sets more than him. But, well, physically I found myself fine. It's true that maybe I had a few physical problems. That might also be because of the three sets that I played yesterday or the day before. But I think that wasn't the reason. I didn't lose the match because of that. As I said before, if I had gone for my opportunities, for those break points in the third set or perhaps in the second, perhaps I could have won the match. But in the end, in those matches when you're playing well and you're playing against such good players, you have to go for opportunities, for the few opportunities you might have. If you don't do that, the next time whenever he has those opportunities he's going to go for them, and he can beat you.","As you were saying, it was really good tennis out there. We've seen you playing really good tennis in the days before. What are your shortterm goals?","Well, continue working as good as I can, and I'll continue to give my best in every single match and every tournament that I play. You know, there are a lot of tournaments, and hopefully I will be doing better and better. In the end, it's just like a wheel. You have to win tournaments, you have to gain confidence, get points, and go up in the ranking. At the end, it's everything. It's like a wheel that you have to try to get it going. It's not easy, because these tournaments are complicated. If you're not playing against a top 16 in the first round, then you will have to in the second round. It's complicated to make it very deep in these tournaments. As I said at the beginning, the goal is to continue training as good as possible and to continue preparing for the tournaments at my best possible level.","Apart from today's result, which of course you're sad about it, what is your feeling? How do you leave Madrid? Do you think you're feeling better? Playing better? Hopefully you will do good in Rome and Roland Garros. I guess you're satisfied with what you did this week.","Well, whenever I'm a little more calmly or time goes by or the hours or whatever, I'll try to stick with the positive things, as every single week. With every tournament sometimes you have more positive things and sometimes you have less. So I'll hold on to the positive things and I'll try to, as I said, just take all the positive things from this week and continue getting better. For the tournaments that we have, I will try to play even better than this week. I played well, but as you can see, if you want to have good results you have to play better than I did here. In this sport nowadays, if you just accept it I have to do better. You're not going to make it very far if you accept playing well. You're going to lose.",Do you see yourself very far away from the level that you would like to have?,"Well, I'm not very far away from that. Today I wasn't that far away. Perhaps three points, because there were three key points in the match. Two of them he played really well. It's true if he plays an ace and just touches the line, then bad luck. But bravo for him, because he just puts the ball on the line. Good for him. But the last one was my mistake. The first break point in the second set was a high ball. It was easy. I didn't want to adjust so much, but I didn't strike the ball flatly and it just went out by a few centimeters. After that, the opportunities, the Love30 that I had, I just didn't go for them. In the end, there were two errors on my side until we did the 30all. Points like those were the ones that made the difference. That's the difference between playing well and losing against a top 10 and playing well and winning.", , ,UNK,UNK, 
201,19085,69328,Is he quite scary?,"He is a little bit. I mean, you should see a picture of him. Yeah.",What's his country?,He's from Argentina.,Has he put you in a cage yet?,"He hasn't, but he keeps getting me in headlocks and that, which is not nice. (Laughter.) Not too much back chat.","Is there much in common, do you think, between cage fighting and tennis?","Not really, if you see the way he looks and the way I look. No, a lot of it is the way he talks and the way he acts and how professional he is. He knows if he goes in the ring and messes around, he's going to get beaten up. And the same sort of principle on court. You know, if you don't go in there prepared, you go down a break early on and it's tough to fight your way back the better players you play. A lot of it in sport is the same. I just have to keep working and try and learn as much as I can from him.","Does he go on the road with you, or is it just when you're...","Yeah, he's here in London. We just started three weeks ago, so I don't know what's going to happen, his situation and mine. But at the moment things are working out, so hopefully he can travel with me a lot more, as well.",No,No, 
161,8761,31932,How tough is it to get out there and play these days? Do you find it difficult or...,"It's not that tough. It's still -- I'm still very motivated, and when the body is feeling good it's a lot easier.",Body is feeling good now?,"I had a slight tear last week. I have been out of practice since coming here, arriving here. So, yeah, I wasn't expecting a whole lot out there today.",Were you pleased with the way you fought in the second set?,"I actually felt like my ball striking was pretty good out there. As I said, I haven't been out to play any practice sets the last three or four days since getting here. That's been hard going out there just today straight into it and see what happens. In the back of my mind, I didn't want to do any more damage to my leg, either, obviously before going into another Masters Series next week but more the US Open in a couple weeks' time. So my movement was -- he moved exceptional out there today and I didn't move so well, and that was the difference.",Do you think you'll be able to step it up the next couple of days in terms of your practicing? Did you feel like the leg wasn't affecting you too much?,"Well, it was affecting me a little bit more today than I would have liked; that's for sure. It's more now that hopefully there is no more damage done, and I can get ready for Cincinnati next week.",Have you been watching Kim's comeback at all?,"No, no.",Yes,Yes, 
43,6579,24108,Can you let us into one or two of the little specifics that you're thinking about when you're out there on this surface?,"Well, you need to be patient on the clay courts. You can't just go and blast your way through opponents. Because, you know, to hit big shots on the clay, normally there is not that much pace on the ball that's coming at you. So you have to generate a lot of the power yourself, which is a lot more tiring than on a grass court, for example. But you also don't want to become passive and when the ball is there not go for your shots. You need to make sure you pick the right moments to go for it. At times today I did that  well, throughout the course of the match I did it very well. And there were times when I was getting too far behind the baseline and being a bit too passive. I just need to try and make sure I get that balance right. And when I do, I play some good clay court tennis.",Obviously you still have some work here at Roland Garros. But I'd like to know whether in the past months or recently you have been thinking about how you would feel to come back to Wimbledon as the defending champion.,"Well, I have been asked about it a few times the past few weeks. But it's not something I have thought much about in the last, yeah, 10, 12 months. I haven't thought loads about it. Well, 12 months ago I hadn't won Wimbledon. But, yeah, last 10 months or so. But I'm sure, you know, as the time gets nearer, and, you know, get ready to play the first match on Monday, I'll definitely  you know, I'll be excited about it. I will be nervous. It was an experience, something I have never experienced before. Players have talked about it in the past, that it's a great experience. But it can also be a nerveracking one on you. Yeah, I will look forward to it, I'm sure.",You mentioned that you say certain people don't think you're a good clay court player. Do you think you're a good clay court player?,"Well, I have had decent results here, made the semis obviously, a couple of quarterfinals. So, you know, it's not been as good as obviously, you know, when you see guys like Rafa and obviously Novak and Roger, you know, they are three of probably the greatest clay court players, along with Borg and a few others, in terms of their results on the surface. Definitely not up on par with them. But, you know, with the other guys, I feel like I have done a decent job. There is not loads of guys that have had better results consistently here. I feel like I can play good clay court tennis. But I need to  you know, to win this event, you need to play great clay court tennis. That's something I haven't done yet.","Today's match, how important was the net cord at 1530, the 20th or 21st game?","Well, yeah. It turned out to be very important. But you can't  overa match that's that long, I could look back at points that happened at 42 in the fourth set as well. But, you know, obviously that point turned out to be very important to that game. But, yeah, you can't look at one point to decide a match of that length.",Your record in fiveset matches is one of the best around. Is that one of the statistics that you're most proud of?,"Yeah. I mean, obviously I didn't feel great physically last night, whereas in a lot of the other fiveset matches I have played I have felt very good. So this was a very tough one for me to come through. But, yeah, that's really the point of doing the training. You know, I think I lost my first few fiveset matches. I was like 14 or something at the start, so I have won quite a few of my last 15, 16 fivesetters. That's what the training is for.",Yes,Yes, 
145,14413,52327,Is it different to beat a mentor than it is to beat another highly ranked player who you don't have that relationship with?,"No. I mean, I wouldn't say so. Obviously Andy and I are really good friends off the court. On the court, we're going to lay it all out there. You know, I obviously wouldn't -- I don't like that he's out of the tournament. I mean, it kind of stinks that we played in the round of 32. But I don't think it was any different, no.","Couple nights ago when I asked Andy to set up this match, I asked what had changed about your game, he said you were playing more like you did when you first turned pro. Do you agree with that? If so, why?","Yeah, I think so. Playing more aggressively. Now that I've won a lot of matches this year, even though I got sick, I still kind of picked it up right after that. So it's kind of similar to 2007. I came from college winning all the time pretty much. So I was real confident then, and I'm confident now. I think last year, you know, I kind of hit a rut and I wasn't hitting on all cylinders when I came into this tournament, and that's why I lost first round. He's probably right in some respects there. I am playing like I was in 2007, only better.",Is the improvement mainly in conditioning as well as just match experience?,"I think match experience, conditioning. I think physically I'm a lot stronger. Spend a lot of time in the weight room. Got to put most of the credit with my new coach, though. In February -- I went to Australia, cramping in the third set in Australia. Wasn't really playing that great. I came back and I played in Memphis, Delray Beach, was just playing horrible. I started working with him. Next thing I went out to Indian Wells, I did well there. I've just been playing well ever since.",Does he emphasize more off-court work?,"No, he's more on-court. He knows my game. We both work -- I mean, practice, he's on the court with me at Saddlebrook in Tampa. So we're good friends off the court, too. He can kind of relate to me. So, uhm, yeah, the stuff he's done with my game, the way I go about thinking in a match, has helped me a lot.",You said in your first press conference that your fitness was still getting back to full level. Did you feel an urgency had you to close the match out early?,"I felt comfortable. I sweat a lot. My leg was cramping a little bit in the fifth set. I overcame that. You know, it was nice weather out there. It's not that humid. You know, it's not too hot. You know, that kind of helped. If that match maybe started at noon, might have been a different story. I'm glad it went the way it did.",Yes,Yes, 
190,22543,81923,How close do you think you came to pulling it off then?,"Uhm, I think I had my chances in the second set. You have to create the opportunity but also execute, and I was probably a bit too defensive on those important points. But I always believed I could win. There's no point in my going out there if I don't believe that I can win. I just wanted to give it everything and leave everything out there on the court.",You obviously had a set way you wanted to play. You did execute it pretty well. How difficult is it to sustain that level again and again against someone who hits the ball like Sharapova?,"I just wanted to just make every ball, make her play every ball, and just fight. Because Maria's a fighter. She's never going to give up. That's what makes her a champion. That's why she's won this tournament before. She's won Grand Slams and been No.1 in the world, so I'm going to have to go out there and compete and give it my all.","When you're out there, you're very quiet returning shots. Your opponent was screaming. Was it hard to concentrate?","I didn't really notice it at all. And I thought I was kind a bit loud today, as well (smiling).",Was that because when somebody is making such a lot of noise you find yourself being drawn into it?,"No, I didn't really notice it at all.","When you watch Maria as a spectator on the television, is the noise apparent to you?","No. All players make different sounds, so it's just kind of part of the game.",No,No, 
211,15269,55239,"You also mentioned that other players are more taller, more powerful, stronger. Players like yourself who don't have those sorts of abilities, could there possibly be a perception do you have that you're disadvantaged and there might be a different type of champion in the future?","I don't think it's a disadvantage. I think there are some advantages, there are some disadvantages. But it's more important the way you manage it on the court. It's more important to know your strengths and to know what maybe you are not doing right and try to improve those things. Then the physical aspect is not that important.","You've had a good solid season, with two titles. You struggled a bit in the majors and some of your earlier successes at Grand Slam tournaments. I'm just wondering why you think you haven't performed well in the big events, and if this is an event where you can really put that behind you?","I don't know. I don't know why, and I wish I could do better in the Grand Slams next time. So I'm going to think about it. Try to review my schedule again. Maybe it was a little bit of a scheduling mistake. Maybe I wasn't just ready for those tournaments. So I'm going to try to manage it in the best way I can, and try to do my best next year.","We know that you are in the final in the previous Championship here in Doha, now you are realizing good results in the second win. Do you have such feeling in some countries that you feel better in some countries or is it just like that?","Well, Doha is definitely great for me, because I have only good memories from here. I don't know what's going to happen in the future, it may change. But so far it brings me luck (smiling).",We have to make Grand Slam here to win it.,"For sure, for sure.", , ,Yes,Yes, 
3,1719,6152, , ,Can you just talk a little bit about today's match? Looks like you were kind of in trouble in that one.,"I mean, I was playing a really good friend, yeah. It's always difficult to play a friend. I was a little bit nervous, especially in the beginning and the end. But I'm happy to pull it through for the first time being in the quarterfinals here.","Can you talk about that friendship? How long have you guys known each other, how that has evolved?","We've known each other since we were like 10, 11 years old. We've known each other for a long time. We went for dinner last night, as well. You know, we're really close friends. Yeah.",Talk about the match at all last night at dinner?,"A little bit. We were making fun of each other, that the match was postponed, you know, till 12:00. No, just that we're, you know, going to lock each other up in the bathroom. That was just for fun. Yeah.",Didn't put anything in each other's dishes or anything?,"No, we were actually sharing a little bit as all, so if one got food poisoned, then the other would to.",Yes,Yes, 
105,21913,79620,What was the reason they went to Denmark?,Because my dad was a professional soccer player. First he was playing for Poland. Then he was sold to Germany. Then he was sold to Denmark. And he took my mother with him (laughter).,Did you play any other sports as a child?,"Yeah, I played so many different kinds of sports. I played handball. I've been swimming. I've played soccer. I've played piano. I've sang in the choir. You know, I've done so many different things. Playing badminton. Yeah, really a lot of different sports. But tennis was the thing that I liked the most.","Did you ever think you might go the soccer route, or were you not as good?","I had to choose. But I actually didn't like soccer too much because it was only the guys. And, you know, it wasn't really fun. None of my friends were playing or anything. So, you know, it kind of took me away from that. So that's the reason, yeah.","It sounds like you had a normal childhood. You weren't one of these kids taken off to a tennis academy, has their childhood taken away. Do you feel like you grew up normally?","Yeah, I really feel that I've grown up normally. I mean, I've never -- I could never imagine myself practicing in an academy away from my family, away from my friends. That's not the way I would like to do it. For sure for some people that's the way. But for me it was just, you know, being with my friends, having a good time off the court. You know, I enjoyed playing every day. I took my friends. We're having like, you know, a grill party or whatever on the courts, then went and playing a little bit, then went off again. That's the way I liked it to be. You know, we were playing for ice cream every day. So, I mean, yeah, I think I've had a pretty normal childhood, but just traveling a bit more than the rest of my friends.","You didn't have to buy ice cream very much, did you?",I think actually our parents were buying.,No,No, 
53,2335,8438,"Unrelated to on the court, there is a table tennis in the players lounge. Is that something that you do play and do a lot of players on the tour play? How fun is it? How enjoyable is it, just as an aside, to get away from on the court?","You know, I don't have to play. I just stand there. I say, I'm from China. They say, Okay, get up here. (Laughter). No, joke. I mean, I saw Srebotnik play today. Then she was like, Hey, I'm Chinese table tennis. I say, Okay, show me one point. And opponent just serve and then she lose the ball. I was like, This is not like Chinese table player. She like, Get up here. She was so angry she want to show me how good she is. Yeah, I mean, I was try a little bit table tennis in like long time ago, but I think tennis is better so I give up. (Smiling).",Are the players good at the game? Who is the best?,"Who is the best? I mean, normally the player always play against the coach, you know. Yeah, I think, I don't know, maybe coach want to make player happy so always player win all the time. (Smiling).",You make fun of your husband quite a bit. We were wondering if he ever gets you back or goes to a corner and cries? What's the reaction he usually has? Is there retaliation from him?,"I mean, he always try to be like nice one, you know. I was the worst one. But so don't listen what he do, what he say, and don't look what he do. Because sorry to say that, but sometimes the guys is a little bit faking, you know. Yeah, but how you say? Yeah, he was traveling like it's tough time for him, as well. He always got a lot of pressure, because he was give up the job just traveling with me. So that's why after  I was feeling he pay a lot for me, so that's why I was feeling I wish after I was retire I can pay back to him. Yeah.","On Thursday and Friday here there is a men's invitational tournament as well as the women's match with firstround losers from the Montreal tournament. I'm wondering what you think about that. Is it good to have the men playing here, or does it detract from the women's game?","When they start, next year?",They start tomorrow. There is a couple men's invitational exhibition matches.,Oh., Yes,Yes, 
133,22475,81636,Both still working?,"Both are still working, yes.","How did you get from lawyers' kid, especially two working lawyers, to become a tennis player at this level?","Complete luck. No one in my family plays tennis. I just came upon it one day. Just thought, Hey, I'll try it. You know, it's worked out pretty well.",So you got addicted pretty quickly?,For sure. Right away.,First time?,"First time, fell in love.","Went home and said, I got to play tennis every day; get me lessons?","Every single day. My parents fed me balls. Eventually it turned into having a coach, and then it went to being at an academy.",Yes,Yes, 
1,17382,62986,How disappointing is that loss for you?,"The tennis I thought was great. I thought he played really well. I thought I played quite well. The only thing I really have to be disappointed with is I wish I would have sort of guts it out a bit more, tried to play on my terms. I was waiting for him too much and I let him dictate. I wish I would have just in some moments sort of stepped up a bit more and put it out there a little bit more. I think that's what made the biggest difference. He sort of showed the courage and he put it all out there. I hesitated a little bit. I don't know if that's lack of matches or what it is, but it's something that I can easily take care of for the next time around.","When you're facing match points on his serve, do you have a tactic or is it more instinct? Like what's going through your mind?","Well, I wish I would have played those two points, I believe it was 30All in deuce like I did play on the match points. I think those are the moments I really stepped up and said, Okay, if he's going to beat me, I'm going to make him beat me. I'm not just going to sort of lose it and give it over to him. I wish I would have sort of, in a way, stepped up a little bit earlier.","Obviously serving is one of your strengths. Return of serve, is it something you work on in practice or is it something you kind of spend time and you're needing to improve?","I think so. He played really well in that there was sort of a momentum shift after that second set, that long game, where I had a bunch of those chances. Especially on one of them he came up with a great lob from the forehand side. You know, those kind of moments I shouldn't have left maybe that switch around the match, but it made a big difference for him and you could even see by his reaction. I wish I would have just been a bit more aggressive, and I think I would have had more opportunities on his service games.","How do you sum up this week for you, and how is your body feeling, especially your foot?","It's a week that's exceeded my expectations by far. Coming into here, other than playing probably six matches, I haven't played tennis for ten weeks. I came in here with a week's training. My body is a little bit beat up, but it's all the kind of progressional pains that I know I go through this right now and it's going to have me better prepared by the time Wimbledon comes around. The feet and the right foot especially is good. I'm happy with the way things are going, the progress I'm making. Obviously there is always little things, but everything is under control and the progress is definitely positive.","There has been a debate this week about the dominance of the big servers at this tournament, and I'm just wondering, who do you see as the best server in the world?",I believe myself.,Yes,UNK, 
236,4705,17307, , ,Kept your composure. You were down. There was rain.,"It was a battle. Just one of those good old battles. Nothing too great, nothing too bad. Just I mean, she was playing well, and I just had to find a way.","The level, not your best tennis but playing well enough to win again and again. Was that sort of what you were feeling out there?","Definitely. Like I said, Mona's a great player. When she's on she's playing some good ball. Obviously when you're not on it's tough to match that, but I think today I just stuck in there and I knew that if I kept at it, I would eventually get my chances, which was good. So I just hung in and kind of just waited for it.",How did you feel about your net approaches today?,0 for 10 or something?,"No, but you were moving in. Taking chances. They didn't all turn out great, but...","There was actually some good ones. She hit actually some good passes on some of them. Going into that girl's backhand is serious. Her backhand down the line is no joke. I learned my lesson a few times on that. But other than that, I thought I was coming in pretty well and I thought I was seeing the ball well.",Yes,Yes, 
103,15930,57828,What do you think it says about you that you never did wave the white flag given all that you went through?,"Just perseverance and competitiveness and knowing that I've spent so much time and sacrificed so much for this sport and for my career, that if I ever had the opportunity I'd give it another go. I know that in some format I'd like to stay in the game of tennis even after I'm done playing. So just coming back and just kind of showing everybody, like, Hey, I'm still around, that was another, you know, just reason for trying to make a comeback. But honestly, like I have said many times, it's just been a blast this last year, and I hope I keep it going for several more.",Your dad was talking about the first time you came to this you were eight years old.,"Yeah, I still have the poster in my room.",Do you remember much about that night?,"I remember some. I don't remember every day, but I definitely remember the Pernfors Wilander match. I think it was on Louis Armstrong where I was there until 2:30, 3:00 in the morning. We started up higher up, and then by like 1:00 a.m. they let everybody move down closer to the courts. I remember also watching Sampras and holding up the 120 miles per hour signs, which now I guess you'd have to change that to like 135. There are a few memories like that that stick out for sure. I remember being with my brother and sister  my mom didn't make it. It was a fun time and I was already big into tennis, but that even made it even more just being able to see the biggest stage in the U.S. for tennis.",How did you feel about the energy today when you were you're on court?,"No, it was good. It was an outside court, but definitely had the crowd support. Had, you know, my girlfriend; several members of my friends and family were here. They didn't let me slide. I started a few games pretty poorly at the end, and they kind of got on me and was able to push me through.","Can you recall anything interesting about watching last year's Open, anything interesting? Did you follow it closely?","Not super closely. You know, I just remember at my house back home just like every time watching the night matches and then pulling for my buddies that were still playing, the other U.S. guys. Just, you know, I kind of had the taste in my mouth because I had just gotten back playing. So it was disappointing not really disappointing that I wasn't playing just because I had just started  but it definitely got the juices going thinking this is where I want to be in a year. I don't know if I was really expecting to be here in a year in the position that I'm in. Definitely one of those things where, you know, you watch it and you're hopeful.",Yes,Yes, 
49,11700,42683,Last year you were quite tired during the second round.,"Well, hopefully it won't be 12:00 at night Rod Laver start this time.",Is that still way past your bedtime?,"Yeah. I mean, I was getting tired then and it was like 8:00 (smiling).","The fans at the start of the game, they were fantastic for you. Are you getting used to that sort of reception on the big arena here?","I am. I mean, look, the crowd got me through last year, got me through today. If you had to leave because of the rain, I'm sure they got annoyed. But in the next round, hopefully I can have as much supporters as I can.",They were singing you were Australia's No.1. Is that where you see yourself?,It's hard to say that. I got to the second round. There's another match ahead of me.,"Looking at the next match, may be Marin Cilic. Are you confident playing him?","You know, look, I know what I have to do if I play him. It's definitely hold my serve for a while. I'm going to try my best. I think I can compete now. We'll see when it starts.",Yes,Yes, 
163,8895,32402,There's probably a sense of you don't have the perspective you might have if you got to that ranking at 25.,"Yeah, maybe in some ways.","The trajectory is up, up, up, you're there, you think, I'm going to stay here.","Yeah, maybe.  It's not an easy thing to do.  That's what I spoke about the other day.  For Roger to be able to stay No.1 for the last four, five years, I think a lot of people outside tennis sort of take it for granted.  It's not easy, whatsoever. Yeah, being that top guy that everyone wants to knock off week in and week out, that just shows how guess, to be able to handle that.","With regards to Rafa, he has accumulated more points at No.2 than a lot of guys had at No.1.  Do you think that's something the public sort of doesn't get, how really good he's been as a No.2?","I think they probably get it.  I think from where I see it anyway, I think a lot of people realize how close he is to Roger.  A lot of people, even outside the tennis world, I think realize that he's had Roger's measure in a lot of big matches. You know, he's basically only been two Wimbledon finals where Roger has had the better of him in a lot of ways. When you have a guy like Roger that's had stand-out years the last three or four years, probably better than Pete and Andre and all those guys had at their best.  So, yeah, obviously you're going to have to have a great year to pass him and get the No.1 ranking.  But, you know, it's only around the corner for him.", , , , ,No,No,negated question
80,11836,43102,Can you remember the angriest you have been on court?,"Well, obviously I have gotten older. I definitely got a long way to mature still. But I do believe I have got a bit of a cooler head on my shoulders than I did a few years ago, and, you know, I aim to learn every day. I'm very fortunate that I have got a team around me that is very (phone ringing). So to be honest I have lost my train of thought now.","You said you have been working with your team a lot on that, so is there any particular methods or to make sure you keep that attitude on court?","Never been a complete head case. You're trying to make me look like a head case now. But obviously, you know, I was young. I'm still young, I like to think, but I was younger. You know, I may not have knocked out with situations with quite as much calmness as I'm doing right now, and I believe what brings a lot of good things to me right now is that I'm able to move on from things. I can roll with the punches more, because there is a lot of punches out there, you know. I'm competing against another competitor who wants to win just as much as I do. So it's a lot of back and forth. The best chance I give myself is, you know, that I be my own best friend.","What happened with the new coaching team you have had for more or less a year? So with the previous situation, did that just reach a natural conclusion? What was the reason for that change?","A lot of stern looks. To be honest, it's constant reminders. In the end, it's up to me to make the changes. It's up to me to take responsibility for my own actions and to take responsibility to whatever happens out on the court. All my team can do around me is give me the tools to use them, but it's up to me to, in the end, actually use them.",Was that your personal reasons or the coach's?,"Well, I finished with a coach who I had done a lot of good work with at the beginning of last year. That was for personal reasons. You know, then it was a sudden thing. It's something that took a while for me to then kind of find my feet again. I have been very fortunate that I have such good people around me right now.",Have you tried transcendental meditation?,"No, his personal situation.", UNK,UNK, 
205,12768,46426,A little bit different being in singles than doubles match. (Photographer interruption.),"You know, I wasn't in love with the scheduling as far as having to play twice. It's obviously pretty hot here. Normally it wouldn't  three, four years ago wouldn't have been a big deal at all. I would've probably preferred to play a couple times and get out there and wouldn't have been that big of a deal. Recently things can sort of snowball and you can think too much about the schedule before it happens and get to the future. That's one of the things that I try to that I work on a lot is not letting my mind get in the future and stay in the present and worry about now, now and worry about later, later. So, you know, it is what it is. I got a doubles match this afternoon and deal with it then.",What are some of the things you're most going to miss about being a pro tennis player after you retire?,"You're never going to get that feeling again, just like the winning sort of feeling. Nothing will ever duplicate that. That's what I'll miss most. I'll miss a lot of friendships I've made over the past 15, 16 years out here. That's about it.","Is it getting easier for you as you play a little bit more this summer to deal to the issues spoke about? And also, are you hearing from people going through similar issues? You feel like you're fulfilling your mission in helping others?","I hope so. Answer the second part first. I just heard from a kid when I was walking off the court. Thank you for what you do with mental illness. Couldn't have been more than 12, 14 years old. Yeah, that makes me feel good. I wouldn't call it necessarily my mission. I hope to help really bring awareness to show that there can be a role model that can be positive and can shed some light on it and that whole thing. And personally, that stuff is not really in the forefront of my mind. I forgot the first part of your question. Personally that stuff isn't in the forefront of my mind because I'm still trying to I don't want to embarrass myself out here. I played really terribly in the first match that I played in Atlanta and it sort of felt off. Just felt like, Is this going to be a sort of a am I going to be a walkover the whole time? I was real nervous in that match and just did not play well at all. Didn't feel well at all. Felt much better on the doubles court. But I'm glad that it's not that.",Any thoughts on facing Andy Murray in your next singles match?,"No good thoughts. (Laughter.) No, look, of the top guys, you know, of the guys that have been dominate in my era, he's the guy I've had the most success with. I believe it's 44. So I would've liked to have had that 44 and just coasted off, but he might get me one more time. You never know, you know. I certainly played well today. He's pretty fantastic so far. He's won a ton of matches. He's won more matches than anyone this year, so he'll be tough.", , ,Yes,UNK,UNK?
34,174,591,Any fears for Wimbledon at the moment?,"I mean, I'm going to play no matter what, even if I'm on one leg (smiling). Yeah, I will take a few days off from serving and give it a little break and see how it goes.",Do you feel the fates have been against you?,"A little bit, but I think there are much worse things in life. It's been a rough time for me these past couple of months, for sure, with, you know, my tennis and all these changes and a couple of injuries here and there. I know it will turn around and things will start going my way soon.",Will you have more treatments today?,"I will go see the doctors and physios again. Just rest a little bit today, tomorrow at least, and see how it feels on the weekend. You know, just kind of save myself for matches maybe.",(Indiscernible.),"Well, they know I intend to play, so it's just about managing it to the best of my abilities because it is a Grand Slam.",What are your memories of last year? Obviously Wimbledon was a massive highlight.,"Yes, I'm looking forward to going back to Wimbledon, of course. You know, it was the highlight of my career so far.
