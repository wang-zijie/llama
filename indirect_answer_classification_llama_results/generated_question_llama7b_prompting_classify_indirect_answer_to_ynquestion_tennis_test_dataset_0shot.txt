input yn question: Is there anything she did particularly well today that she didn't do well the first three times?
input answer: I think the difference between her on clay and grass and on hard court is her movement.  On clay she struggle a lot more to move and to slide. On grass with some bad bounce and also it's more difficult to move, she really struggled more on this side of her game.  I think her movement is the key of her game.  She is not hitting super hard but she moves very well. I think on the hard courts you have to hit maybe five, six times like this from the lines to make points.  You don't need to hit like this on clay and grass courts.  So on hard courts she's really hard to beat.

input yn question: This is the kind of match in the past that you would have expected yourself to win. It would have been routine to win. Did it feel at all that way today?
input answer: I don't know. I don't think about the score when I'm out there. So even if I'm up 5Love, I don't see 5Love. I just see I need to get the set. That's kind of what I'm thinking about. Nothing is really routine. You never know how well your opponent is going to play or if you don't have a good day. Obviously it's nice to spend less time on the court, and not be in long sets. Obviously a win is a win no matter what it is, but it's nice when it's more routine.

input yn question: When you came here last year you had just beaten Novak in Perth. Can you compare how you feel like you're traveling now compared to here 12 months ago?
input answer: I probably wouldn't say I'm you know, the year has gone by quickly. It's tough to answer that question. Obviously I was playing very good at Hopman Cup this year and last year. This is my first tournament for the year. I won it last year. I'm not looking at it to defend it. I'm looking at obviously winning another title. If I start looking at defending the title I'll get nervous and I'm probably not going to defend it more than likely. I'm looking at this is as a positive and trying to win here as best as I can, regardless of what I have to defend.

input yn question: Comparing Davis Cup and preparing for ties compared to this, what's better for you: having someone like Pat Rafter around? Do you respond to that kind of thing?
input answer: Look, with me, like, you know, I can work with Pat  like the Davis Cup is great. I love working on the team, and I can't wait for when Davis Cup starts. I love being in that role of being in the team. To have a shot at even qualifying this year if I do so it will be huge. I think regardless of who's working with me, it's my sort of tennis my game is just it relies on me. People can say they can help you with a lot of tips. Even my dad who has been with me for 11 years has done a great job. You know, that can take the place, but saying people can help, it's not really for my tennis, it's all about me. I've got to find that in me. People give you great tips along the way and can help you and stuff, which I'm ready for any help, but you're not going to become Federer, Rafa, or Novak if you don't do it yourself. That's for sure.

input answer: I mean, I played some really good matches in Sydney where I probably played even better. Movement-wise, I think today -- the ball was in my court. I was able to move her around and still really -- like I didn't feel like I was put under pressure too much by her. Balls were sitting up nice and high, in a nice position, where I was just really able to focus and dictate the points. So that's probably also why it looked easy from my side.

input yn question: How different has this year been for you? In the past you've had injuries, but things have clicked quite quickly when you started. Obviously you found success quite quickly. Now you've had to be patient and understand things will take their time. Is there this a different sensation for you?
input answer: It's all about moments, and all the moments are different. Different feelings, different situations on the career of everyone. You have to pass all these moments. I had injuries; I had much more good than bad moments. But I had some tough moments with injuries in the past, and now I'm not injured. That's a very important point. I am on the court. If I am on the court, I have the chance to play well and win matches. Last year for six months I didn't have that chance. If I am not winning matches today, I accept. If I am not playing well enough, only thing I can do is accept, stay positive, work as much as I can, and be positive knowing that the normal thing if I had success during 11 years, why can't I have success again if I am motivated enough? I am fit; I don't have injuries; and I cannot forget to play tennis in six months.

input yn question: Can you say a few words about your new coach? How different is he?
input answer: Well, we started working together at the US Open. But since we started working together, we never had much time to have a long period together because there were tournaments all the time and we couldn't working on specific things. When you want to work on something specific, you need more time. So what was important for me was that he could watch me play in different circumstances on different surfaces so that he could have a real opinion about my game. Now he knows. Even if he had an idea before, now he knows exactly what I need to work on during the offseason. I really hope he's going to bring me new things for my game. I know I have to work on many things. I have a margin for progression. This is positive. This is why I chose him. And also, I know he's going to be very strict about my game and my physical training.

input answer: Um, I don't know when a time is. I mean, I don't know if it's yesterday, today, or tomorrow. (Smiling.) I mean, I think at way I look at it is the more matches you win, whether it's here, whether it's at a Grand Slam, the better your ranking is gonna be, I mean, yeah, the further you get in a tournament. So. I don't know. I never really focus, this is my time, it's now or never. Might as well -- yeah, I don't know, jump off one of the canyons over there if you have that mentality. It's pretty tough to think like that. You just have to -- you know, even if you do feel -- sometimes you come into a tournament and you feel great and you feel like you're confident and everything's working well, hitting great in practice; sometimes you come in and those things don't quite work match in match situations. Other times you feel kind of crappy on the court, and you come in, and all of a sudden you find yourself swinging away and balls are going in and you're in a later stages of the tournament, you're loose because you didn't really expect much. It's very different. It makes the sport really unique.

She's taking the opportunities, and she didn't look very nervous in the match.  So good qualities, but who knows what's going to happen for her in the future.  We'll see.  I.

But obviously this would just help on - how do you say - a level starting the season great in Australia, finishing the season great in London would be, you know, the circle is sort of closed. Then again, I'm still two matches away, two really tough matches. I'm most likely going to play against top-five guys. Depends who I play, I don't even know yet. It's going to be a tough weekend ahead of me. That's my focus right now. So far it's been good, you know. I won against top-10 players in straight sets.

Now, do you feel that that just having those -- the fact that you've made it to nine finals on different surfaces, does that give you tremendous confidence in your ability to progress here over the course of a two-week tournament?

Will you bother to make comments on the significance of this match? Because in China it's not easy first to have excellent, you know, Chinese male player as you are in Top 10.
input answer: Actually, a lot of people ask me why in China we only have female competent players but not male competent players. I would say probably the male players in China prefer to choose table tennis, as a joke. Then I would say that they havent woken up. Today Im happy that Ze Zhang beat a Top 20 player in China. I think that's very important, a significant match for him, and he's going to gain more confidence in his professional career. If he failed to win Gasquet today, probably he's going to be a little bit negative towards the match. Its a big step for him to win this match.

It's very hot, so you need to make sure that going in, you're hydrated. When you come out, it takes, you know, two, three hours before you're feeling normal again.

It's blue, and when the ball hits it and -- not always, but you can see the marks.  Because there are so many marks you usually don't know which one it is.

But every event you play and every match you play is a new experience and a new challenge, and you just have to accept it that way and take the best out of it. So last year wasn't that much fun for me, haven't won a single set. But I gained that experience. It's different this year, because I'm coming here as a Grand Slam winner and more matured player, stronger mentally and physically on the court.

She's one of the best tennis players ever to play the game, both women's and men's. She's incredible whatever she does. I probably think she's trying to relieve some of the pressure that she has. Everybody talks about the Serena Slam. Everybody talks about the Golden Slam, will she make it? She has another match, US Open as well.

input answer: I think we already have a rivalry. It's not the next. It's already existing there for many years. Andy is deservedly a winner today on the court. I thought what made the difference was his serve and my serve. I didn't serve well the first set and a half. After, I just wasn't able to serve. But not taking anything away from him, from his victory. He deserved it. He stepped in, played some great shots. Most of all the moments when he needed to, he served very, very well. Breakpoints that one game, when I had I think four, five opportunities to break back, he just came up always with big serves, so I couldn't do much. But it was a great week all in all for me. I didn't know what to expect obviously coming in, first hard court tournament. I know people always expect me to do well, but I try to be modest with my expectations and just kind of see how each day goes. When I reflect on the week, of course it's positive. I'm playing better as the tournament progressed, and hopefully I can continue in the same style in Cincinnati.

input answer: You know, it's a court.  I don't know if it's so much the court.  I think, you know, the way the balls react to it.  When you play with new balls it's like a different surface.  Then all of a sudden seven, eight games later, it's just a lot different. You know, but I guess that's the process that it takes to kind of get the surface you want.  I don't know if you're going to get it perfect the first time out.  But it is what it is, man.  I don't mind the surface.  I don't mind the effect that it has.  It's just different.

input yn question: Did you feel that Novak got himself more focused in the second and third sets? What was the difference in his level of play?
input answer: Well, I don't know what was difference. I think it was just small pieces of difference. I don't know how to say it. But in the beginning of the second set, I had like five breakpoints. He had one. He made it, it was 3Love. It could easily be 21 with a break for me, and it was completely other way. So it's tough to say what was different. I think he was playing pretty much the same. But, as I said, the wind doesn't help at all to my game. But it's the same for both of us. I have to deal with that. That's how it is. First set, beginning of the second set, I had a feeling I was even better from the rallies, which is not every time with him. I was beating him from the rallies. But, you know, it just change a bit with the conditions. I didn't keep with that. Him, yes. So that was probably the difference.

input yn question: Given the nature of the way you got to the Finals in the first place, is there enough in the tank to do things the hard way again this week?
input answer: Well, I felt okay on the court today. I don't think that was the reason why I lost the match. I guess if I was to play a threehour match which was extremely physical, then maybe I would feel fatigued in the latter stages of a match like that. But, yeah, obviously now I need to win my next two matches more than likely, and win them well if I want to go through. That's going to be tricky because Milos obviously played fantastic last week in Paris, and Roger always plays well at this event. So I'm definitely going to have to play better if I want to get through.

Because especially when you have back-to-back tournaments, it's a good way to, you know, see what worked and what didn't work in the previous tournament, what you feel like you might need to work on.

But then again, we play in unbelievable heat sometimes, like in Australia. We had four days of extreme heat. Wind, I have had it, you know. Playing in the rain I think is always tough on the clay. It's just tough for everybody involved, fans, us, conditions, ball boys. You name it, everybody doesn't have a great time. So it's part of what we do.

But now at this point, are you pleased you made that decision to do that then? Was there a point when you worried you might not be ready for this tournament?
input answer: I play Eastbourne first time against Lucie. It was big fight. Very long match. Next day I start to feel the leg. I play against Lepchenko. I won it, but next day I woke up and I really couldn't walk without the pain. It was something actually I didn't do it before, but I knew it's before the Wimbledon. If I need to recovery I need some days off. Actually, I hit for the first time little bit on Saturday very easily. I had my first round on Monday. So now I'm very pleased with my decision over there.

input yn question: I think in the WTA ranking, actually a lot of young juniors is catching up. Do you feel a lot of pressure from those junior players? How are you going to still keep very good fitness faced with those pressures?
input answer: Well, I have been on the tour for many years. I started as a young teenager, and I'm 25 years old now. I feel like I have seen a lot of different generations. The reality of it is it's not like your generation is going to be the only one playing tennis. You're always going to see new upandcomers and talent, you know, great players that are juniors and that are making the transition from the juniors to the pros, you know, and it's part of it. When you retire, there's always going to be somebody that takes your place in the rankings and the draws. That's just the reality of it. I feel like I'm somewhere in the middle. When I came up, you know, you had Justine and Kim and the Williamses, and I felt I was kind of the younger of the bunch. Now I'm somewhere in the middle. You see a couple of retirements, some are still playing, and then you see a younger generation. I'm really kind of smack in the middle.

I've got to take the mental gains that I've made, the physical, the match play, everything.  I've got to try to take out the positives. Yeah, obviously disappointed, but I guess move forward and next week I'm going to be playing Fed Cup for Australia, so I have no time to feel sorry for myself.

You know, if you find yourself with a game plan that's just you come out and you're not feeling it or it doesn't quite work, you just really have to find a way to adjust to your opponent and maybe the conditions sometimes and just really figure it out.

input yn question: When you're going against Soderling, you really made some advances. What is your thought about him? Do you scout him? Do you do anything? Do you just do your thing?
input answer: My thought about him is he's a great player. He's solid. There's not really a lot of holes in his game right now. There used to be the errant ball two or three times in the back fence. That doesn't happen anymore. He's solid. It's something I always tell Jenny and my dad when we're talking about scouting guys. The reality of the matter is I'm not good enough to worry about the other guy. That's the reality of the matter. I don't feel like I'm reliable enough in my game to sacrifice just thinking about my execution out there, what I have to do to play and impose my game. I'm fortunate, because if I do execute my game, there's not a whole lot guys can do in the first place. But, you know, as soon as I get better, more reliable out on the court to where I feel very confident with what I'm doing and how I'm doing it, then I'll start to maybe pick apart guy's games. To be honest, I'm just not at that level right now.

If someone slices, if someone really cracks the ball, that's programmed into our minds. So I think that's important.

For me, I didn't have to do anything else in a way. I didn't have to improvise much. All I had to do is play a solid game. I think that was pretty much it for me.

Now my rank was 115, and then you think; like, Okay, you start to do things like this, you don't get in. I'm not getting in here, not there, wildcard. I mean, you still don't know if they gonna give you wildcard or not. So that was a moment they say, Okay, let's play quallies. I said, Whew, yeah, I will have to play quallies or go to a smaller tournament. But it was a little bit shocking experience, you know. Like sometimes you ask for the wildcard and they say, like, Okay, we will let you know. And it's never letting you know. So...

input answer: I cannot compare my success to him. Of course he's the main favorite next to Nadal to win the title of any tournament they play on. They're the best two players in the world. As I said, I have to be confident on the court, have the right attitude, and that's the only way I can beat Roger or Rafa. There is no other way.

But what Caroline, you know, does very, very well is, you know, things that, you know, that a normal tennis fan may not necessarily see. I mean, she moves well, competes extremely hard, and really makes you work for it; whereas Petra, you can see those flashes of great, great tennis. Yeah, two probably different styles, but, you know, I think, you know, Petra is a very exciting player to watch and probably deserves to be in that No.2 spot if she does win.

Can you look back at this point and say, Hey, it was a good tournament? Do you feel you were playing good enough you could win today?

Everybody want to win, so is no need to be upset. But I think today she served good, and with more wind she has more chance than me. Because when I was serving against the wind, I am 1 meter 66, and I try to push as much as I could. But is not like Venus -- she serve on second floor and with the big power. So it's okay.

If somebody told us that when we began our careers, we would think it's a joke or it's not even -- it's like a mission impossible. But this shows that anything is achievable. Doesn't matter where you come from and what kind of facilities you have to train, if you're wealthy or poor. I think with the will and with the desire and the hunger, the determination, you can achieve anything. We showed that, and, you know, I'm pretty proud that we have done so well.

You know, just Rosol came up with incredible serves, very aggressive shots. He was taking his chances. You know, you have those days when your opponents have really nothing to lose and they're going for all the shots. So congratulations to him. It's been an incredible match. Everybody thought maybe he's going to have some ups and downs probably in the fifth set, but he proved everybody wrong. That's what happens. I mean, everybody plays tennis nowadays.

You have to come up with -- I remember that's how I played the whole time, coming up, and then I had to improve so much on my baseline game because all the guys leading the rankings sort of like Ferrero and Nalbandian and Hewitt and Safin and Roddick even, I mean, they were all playing from the baseline.

Obviously the more you win, the more confidence you get. Then again, I've learned my lesson early on in my career where I used to underestimate opponents because of the way they played, the way their techniques worked out, or just said against this guy, I can't lose on grass. Next thing you know, that's what happens. This is where you have to be very, very, you know, sort of mentally strong. I think with the success I've had here, obviously I always come in with somewhat of a pressure.

input yn question: What about players who need to move to the next level? One of our own players, Heather Watson, has suggested that some of our British players are mollycoddled or perhaps lazy. From where you have battled through in Serbia, do you see it that way? Because of the facilities, the LTA gives them so much money, do you think the English players have it a little bit easier?
input answer: There was a lot of talk about the lack of success in British tennis, having Wimbledon, having LTA as a very successful organization who has invested over 40 million into the National Tennis Center. Of course they're expecting to produce a new wave of successful players that can compete with top players for major titles. This country has the history of this sport, obviously beginning with this tournament. There is no reason to believe that they would not want to have more global success and players who are able to reach bigger heights. But, again, it's probably a systemic problem or issue that they have to work with, the mental approach of the players. Having the right conditions, having everything in front of you at your availability to use anytime you like is not essential for success at the top level. It's an individual sport. It's quite different from any other team sport. It's important to have the right mental approach, the hunger for success, the proper surroundings, the people who can encourage you who know in which way you should develop and practice daytoday. In my own experience, I could feel everything that I do on a daily basis on and off the court will reflect sooner or later on my success and on my tennis results. It's very complex and very demanding sport in general because you are alone on the court and you cannot rely on anybody else once you are there. It's you against your opponent. It's becoming more and more popular around the world, which makes the competition stronger. But, again, considering the tradition that this country has in this sport, the conditions that they have with their National Tennis Center, I believe sooner or later they will have a certain amount of players, both men and women, who will fight for major titles.

input yn question: Were these basically ideal conditions for you on clay today?
input answer: I mean, it's been nice actually for the last month on clay.  We've had a bit tough few days just before Monaco.  I think it was quite windy and rainy and a bit. I remember I lost my rhythm a bit from the baseline there that's why I didn't play so well first up in Monaco.  I think it was well really quick conditions all of a sudden the first day. On the match days they always water the court much less than during the practice times because they had more time to water the court, and also it rained more.  But these conditions were very nice, you know. On court, I mean, Corretja asked me, too.  This was perfect conditions for you?  Honestly quick or slow I don't mind.  I've proved myself in Hamburg in the past.  Every time it's a bit slow I like it too because I get more grip and the ball stays a bit lower.  And if it's nicer it's a bit quicker for me which is obviously an advantage. I think you got to be able to play with all conditions on clay because they change sometimes throughout the match.  So you got to be able to adapt and, I think that's a big plus for me that I can do that.

It's been tough coming back from the bottom, from zero, and I think I did it pretty well in a short time. I've been playing only three and a half, four months actually, because November and December were dead. There was no tournaments. I started only end of July.

input answer: Actually, this is not the point of the problem, you know. The problem is that when the linesman call it out and it's not a clear ace which wasn't. I mean, I just hit the ball into the net because I heard it out, then he cannot give a point to him. Even if he take a challenge and the ball is good. That's why we have a challenge to repeat the point. Because the linesman wasn't right; the challenge show it's good; then should be two points. I have no idea where he find out that it's the point for him. No, I never seen that.

With every tournament sometimes you have more positive things and sometimes you have less. So I'll hold on to the positive things and I'll try to, as I said, just take all the positive things from this week and continue getting better. For the tournaments that we have, I will try to play even better than this week. I played well, but as you can see, if you want to have good results you have to play better than I did here.

So my movement was -- he moved exceptional out there today and I didn't move so well, and that was the difference.

input yn question: You mentioned that you say certain people don't think you're a good clay court player. Do you think you're a good clay court player?
input answer: Well, I have had decent results here, made the semis obviously, a couple of quarterfinals. So, you know, it's not been as good as obviously, you know, when you see guys like Rafa and obviously Novak and Roger, you know, they are three of probably the greatest clay court players, along with Borg and a few others, in terms of their results on the surface. Definitely not up on par with them. But, you know, with the other guys, I feel like I have done a decent job. There is not loads of guys that have had better results consistently here. I feel like I can play good clay court tennis. But I need to  you know, to win this event, you need to play great clay court tennis. That's something I haven't done yet.

input yn question: Is the improvement mainly in conditioning as well as just match experience?
input answer: I think match experience, conditioning. I think physically I'm a lot stronger. Spend a lot of time in the weight room. Got to put most of the credit with my new coach, though. In February -- I went to Australia, cramping in the third set in Australia. Wasn't really playing that great. I came back and I played in Memphis, Delray Beach, was just playing horrible. I started working with him. Next thing I went out to Indian Wells, I did well there. I've just been playing well ever since.

input yn question: We know that you are in the final in the previous Championship here in Doha, now you are realizing good results in the second win. Do you have such feeling in some countries that you feel better in some countries or is it just like that?
input answer: Well, Doha is definitely great for me, because I have only good memories from here. I don't know what's going to happen in the future, it may change. But so far it brings me luck (smiling).

input yn question: Did you ever think you might go the soccer route, or were you not as good?
input answer: I had to choose. But I actually didn't like soccer too much because it was only the guys. And, you know, it wasn't really fun. None of my friends were playing or anything. So, you know, it kind of took me away from that. So that's the reason, yeah.
label: No

input yn question: You make fun of your husband quite a bit. We were wondering if he ever gets you back or goes to a corner and cries? What's the reaction he usually has? Is there retaliation from him?
input answer: I mean, he always try to be like nice one, you know. I was the worst one. But so don't listen what he do, what he say, and don't look what he do. Because sorry to say that, but sometimes the guys is a little bit faking, you know. Yeah, but how you say? Yeah, he was traveling like it's tough time for him, as well. He always got a lot of pressure, because he was give up the job just traveling with me. So that's why after  I was feeling he pay a lot for me, so that's why I was feeling I wish after I was retire I can pay back to him. Yeah.

input yn question: Obviously serving is one of your strengths. Return of serve, is it something you work on in practice or is it something you kind of spend time and you're needing to improve?
input answer: I think so. He played really well in that there was sort of a momentum shift after that second set, that long game, where I had a bunch of those chances. Especially on one of them he came up with a great lob from the forehand side. You know, those kind of moments I shouldn't have left maybe that switch around the match, but it made a big difference for him and you could even see by his reaction. I wish I would have just been a bit more aggressive, and I think I would have had more opportunities on his service games.

input yn question: The level, not your best tennis but playing well enough to win again and again. Was that sort of what you were feeling out there?
input answer: Definitely. Like I said, Mona's a great player. When she's on she's playing some good ball. Obviously when you're not on it's tough to match that, but I think today I just stuck in there and I knew that if I kept at it, I would eventually get my chances, which was good. So I just hung in and kind of just waited for it.
label: Yes

                Yes


input yn question: Do you remember much about that night?
input answer: I remember some. I don't remember every day, but I definitely remember the Pernfors Wilander match. I think it was on Louis Armstrong where I was there until 2:30, 3:00 in the morning. We started up higher up, and then by like 1:00 a.m. they let everybody move down closer to the courts. I remember also watching Sampras and holding up the 120 miles per hour signs, which now I guess you'd have to change that to like 135. There are a few memories like that that stick out for sure. I remember being with my brother and sister  my mom didn't make it. It was a fun time and I was already big into tennis, but that even made it even more just being able to see the biggest stage in the U.S. for tennis.

input yn question: The fans at the start of the game, they were fantastic for you. Are you getting used to that sort of reception on the big arena here?
input answer: I am. I mean, look, the crowd got me through last year, got me through today. If you had to leave because of the rain, I'm sure they got annoyed. But in the next round, hopefully I can have as much supporters as I can.

input yn question: With regards to Rafa, he has accumulated more points at No.2 than a lot of guys had at No.1.  Do you think that's something the public sort of doesn't get, how really good he's been as a No.2?
input answer: I think they probably get it.  I think from where I see it anyway, I think a lot of people realize how close he is to Roger.  A lot of people, even outside the tennis world, I think realize that he's had Roger's measure in a lot of big matches. You know, he's basically only been two Wimbledon finals where Roger has had the better of him in a lot of ways. When you have a guy like Roger that's had stand-out years the last three or four years, probably better than Pete and Andre and all those guys had at their best.  So, yeah, obviously you're going to have to have a great year to pass him and get the No.1 ranking.  But, you know, it's only around the corner for him.

input yn question: What happened with the new coaching team you have had for more or less a year? So with the previous situation, did that just reach a natural conclusion? What was the reason for that change?
input answer: A lot of stern looks. To be honest, it's constant reminders. In the end, it's up to me to make the changes. It's up to me to take responsibility for my own actions and to take responsibility to whatever happens out on the court. All my team can do around me is give me the tools to use them, but it's up to me to, in the end, actually use them.

input yn question: Is it getting easier for you as you play a little bit more this summer to deal to the issues spoke about? And also, are you hearing from people going through similar issues? You feel like you're fulfilling your mission in helping others?
input answer: I hope so. Answer the second part first. I just heard from a kid when I was walking off the court. Thank you for what you do with mental illness. Couldn't have been more than 12, 14 years old. Yeah, that makes me feel good. I wouldn't call it necessarily my mission. I hope to help really bring awareness to show that there can be a role model that can be positive and can shed some light on it and that whole thing. And personally, that stuff is not really in the forefront of my mind. I forgot the first part of your question. Personally that stuff isn't in the forefront of my mind because I'm still trying to I don't want to embarrass myself out here. I played really terribly in the first match that I played in Atlanta and it sort of felt off. Just felt like, Is this going to be a sort of a am I going to be a walkover the whole time? I was real nervous in that match and just did not play well at all. Didn't feel well at all. Felt much better on the doubles court. But I'm glad that it's not that.

input yn question: That you know them so well, is it then hard to see them as a foe on the tennis court, to make that switch?
input answer: Used to be. But over the years, playing so many matches against great friends of mine, especially from my country, like Troicki, Tipsarevic, I manage to understand what I need to do on the court. I'm a professional. I want to win as much as they want to. As soon as you step on the court, it's all business.

input yn question: Even though you haven't had time to think about it, you've already seen him play since he came back from his injury. Have you seen anything different, any new weakness, something you can attack that he didn't have before the injury?
input answer: You know, between clay court and indoor is different. Sometimes he is pretty fast for him. That's was he losing control. He cannot control from baseline always. That's was I think he from baseline is pretty fast. That's was for him is very difficult.
