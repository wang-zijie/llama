input yn question: Some people say that when you are trying to do some homework prior to the competition it's very much easy for you to lose because you can't get enough information from the opponent. Is that simply because you don't know the opponent before? Does your coach Carlos help you to change you in this regard? You will stick to what you planned in advance even if you are not so familiar with your opponent?
input answer: I can tell you the answer in the future. When I get to know an opponent that I'm not familiar with, I want to repeat again that for female players, actually we are basically equal to each other in terms of competence. Everybody have the chance to win title.

input yn question: Does he spend a lot of time talking to you about his time at Wimbledon and giving you advice?
input answer: Never.  You have to ask him questions about his playing career for him to talk about it.  At the Open last year, it wasn't, "I use the crowd to get you going."  It's like, "Use the New York crowd to your advantage."  It's never really about him, which I guess is the purpose of a coach. It's amazing kind of how little he discusses it.

I feel like no matter who I play, I have the advantage going up. I feel like I do so many things well, I actually have a great reputation behind me, too.  I think it's a lot of factors.

input yn question: I don't come from a small country like Serbia. Can we even understand the kind of impact that you've had at home?
input answer: If you can believe, for example, for a country that has about maybe 8 million people and we have like three No.1s in the world in tennis, you know, I think that's pretty impressive. If somebody told us that when we began our careers, we would think it's a joke or it's not even -- it's like a mission impossible. But this shows that anything is achievable. Doesn't matter where you come from and what kind of facilities you have to train, if you're wealthy or poor. I think with the will and with the desire and the hunger, the determination, you can achieve anything. We showed that, and, you know, I'm pretty proud that we have done so well. It's really amazing success for Serbian tennis, and hopefully we will inspire other younger generations to come our way as well.

input yn question: A lot of guys go to college and stop after a year or two years. You stayed four; got your degree. Was there ever a point in your time there where you thought about leaving?
input answer: Um, there were good -- after the first year I got to the finals, NCAA's my first year, and they were kind of strong on that one. You get older, and they kind of tend to weaken the deal to go play. Actually, they offered me a coach and offered me some help and expenses to play and travel, but I just -- I loved college too much. I just -- I didn't want to let the team down. Just had too much fun, and I was playing well, and I wanted to finish out and get my degree because you never know what's going to happen with tennis.

Or do you feel that, Oh, God, here I can do really well; I think this could be a good week for me? Or this is not really working out the way I wanted to? How do you feel from one tournament to the next?
input answer: I think it always changes. Because especially when you have back-to-back tournaments, it's a good way to, you know, see what worked and what didn't work in the previous tournament, what you feel like you might need to work on. You always get a better idea of things when you're playing matches, so you're more aware of things and you know what to work on more than maybe when you came into the first tournament after only practicing for three weeks or -- you know, having the tournament I think really helps you.

input yn question: What about players who need to move to the next level? One of our own players, Heather Watson, has suggested that some of our British players are mollycoddled or perhaps lazy. From where you have battled through in Serbia, do you see it that way? Because of the facilities, the LTA gives them so much money, do you think the English players have it a little bit easier?
input answer: There was a lot of talk about the lack of success in British tennis, having Wimbledon, having LTA as a very successful organization who has invested over 40 million into the National Tennis Center. Of course they're expecting to produce a new wave of successful players that can compete with top players for major titles. This country has the history of this sport, obviously beginning with this tournament. There is no reason to believe that they would not want to have more global success and players who are able to reach bigger heights. But, again, it's probably a systemic problem or issue that they have to work with, the mental approach of the players. Having the right conditions, having everything in front of you at your availability to use anytime you like is not essential for success at the top level. It's an individual sport. It's quite different from any other team sport. It's important to have the right mental approach, the hunger for success, the proper surroundings, the people who can encourage you who know in which way you should develop and practice daytoday. In my own experience, I could feel everything that I do on a daily basis on and off the court will reflect sooner or later on my success and on my tennis results. It's very complex and very demanding sport in general because you are alone on the court and you cannot rely on anybody else once you are there. It's you against your opponent. It's becoming more and more popular around the world, which makes the competition stronger. But, again, considering the tradition that this country has in this sport, the conditions that they have with their National Tennis Center, I believe sooner or later they will have a certain amount of players, both men and women, who will fight for major titles.

input yn question: Can you say a few words about your new coach? How different is he?
input answer: Well, we started working together at the US Open. But since we started working together, we never had much time to have a long period together because there were tournaments all the time and we couldn't working on specific things. When you want to work on something specific, you need more time. So what was important for me was that he could watch me play in different circumstances on different surfaces so that he could have a real opinion about my game. Now he knows. Even if he had an idea before, now he knows exactly what I need to work on during the offseason. I really hope he's going to bring me new things for my game. I know I have to work on many things. I have a margin for progression. This is positive. This is why I chose him. And also, I know he's going to be very strict about my game and my physical training.

input answer: I remember some. I don't remember every day, but I definitely remember the Pernfors Wilander match. I think it was on Louis Armstrong where I was there until 2:30, 3:00 in the morning. We started up higher up, and then by like 1:00 a.m. they let everybody move down closer to the courts. I remember also watching Sampras and holding up the 120 miles per hour signs, which now I guess you'd have to change that to like 135. There are a few memories like that that stick out for sure. I remember being with my brother and sister  my mom didn't make it.

input answer: I'm very happy on the court at the moment. I think that's what made the big difference because there was time when I was not really happy being out there because I didn't feel confident and I didn't feel comfortable because I sort of felt I didn't have tools to deal with certain things, you know. Just maybe it was because I wasn't, you know, practicing in the right direction, and I went a little bit off the track there. But now I feel I'm putting the things in place that need to be taken care of and I feel I'm on the right way and that gives me confidence, so I'm back enjoying.

input answer: Um, yeah. Well, honestly, sometimes she was serving at the same place or just body to me, so... Or I think she was just kicking the serve mostly. Like she wasn't really going for ace or something like this, so it was pretty tough to return. But I don't know, it just worked well today.
label: Yes
prediction: 
                Yes


input yn question: Are you saying it did affect your return?
input answer: Actually, this is not the point of the problem, you know. The problem is that when the linesman call it out and it's not a clear ace which wasn't. I mean, I just hit the ball into the net because I heard it out, then he cannot give a point to him. Even if he take a challenge and the ball is good. That's why we have a challenge to repeat the point. Because the linesman wasn't right; the challenge show it's good; then should be two points. I have no idea where he find out that it's the point for him. No, I never seen that.

input answer: I cannot compare my success to him. Of course he's the main favorite next to Nadal to win the title of any tournament they play on. They're the best two players in the world. As I said, I have to be confident on the court, have the right attitude, and that's the only way I can beat Roger or Rafa. There is no other way.

No, I mean, here we are, and that's quite usual. I mean, I think it's a preparation for Wimbledon with everything, you know.

You know, I was like, Oh, not a good start kind of thing. I was down 15-40 here and I felt like I left maybe one or two points out there in those four points.

input answer: Anyway, it was a good one? Perfect. No, but like you say, I think there were some good ones out there, some unusual shots, you know, like the lob, the passing shots, the little flick stuff. You have to come up with -- I remember that's how I played the whole time, coming up, and then I had to improve so much on my baseline game because all the guys leading the rankings sort of like Ferrero and Nalbandian and Hewitt and Safin and Roddick even, I mean, they were all playing from the baseline. This is when I realized I also have to be more patient and not just approach on anything, because they were not coming in anymore.

But obviously this would just help on - how do you say - a level starting the season great in Australia, finishing the season great in London would be, you know, the circle is sort of closed. Then again, I'm still two matches away, two really tough matches. I'm most likely going to play against top-five guys. Depends who I play, I don't even know yet. It's going to be a tough weekend ahead of me. That's my focus right now. So far it's been good, you know. I won against top-10 players in straight sets.

I think today, considering my flu, arriving just yesterday, I can see already the improvement physically. I mean, the way I was moving in the second set and the way I handled all those tough rallies, I was really pleased with that. So that's first my main direction, and then if I feel I need to bring out someone on the court with me, I will do the move, but right now it's not my main priority.

input yn question: I saw you playing very well yesterday against Fognini and today even better, or is it just two different opponents with different games?
input answer: First, it's two different opponents. Second is that I think I was just very consistent. I had a good level yesterday. I felt that early on today I had a good level, too. For me, I didn't have to do anything else in a way. I didn't have to improvise much. All I had to do is play a solid game. I think that was pretty much it for me. Everything else was just coming and I was playing good, game after game, starting to feel a bit more confident. Again, I didn't think Stan played his best tennis, that's true. Everyone saw that. But winning is winning.

input answer: We played I think like 10 days ago. But it's always tough against her. She's always playing very solid tennis. I think I really have to play aggressive against her, definitely serving good, really playing my hundred percent the best tennis; otherwise I'm not going to win, for sure.

I'm happy with the way things are moving on for me at this point. Physically I feel very fit, and mentally I'm very focused on the court and taking every match very seriously.

input answer: Well, I felt okay on the court today. I don't think that was the reason why I lost the match. I guess if I was to play a threehour match which was extremely physical, then maybe I would feel fatigued in the latter stages of a match like that. But, yeah, obviously now I need to win my next two matches more than likely, and win them well if I want to go through. That's going to be tricky because Milos obviously played fantastic last week in Paris, and Roger always plays well at this event. So I'm definitely going to have to play better if I want to get through.

Even when I won those 10 games in a row. It looks like the same in the first set, but those games were just going to my side. But, you know, also was a good game on my side when it was 4-3.

But she's very, very positive woman, always gives me positive energy and always is there even when I'm down, when I'm winning. She always gives me words of encouragement and is always there for me.

Will you bother to make comments on the significance of this match? Because in China it's not easy first to have excellent, you know, Chinese male player as you are in Top 10.
input answer: Actually, a lot of people ask me why in China we only have female competent players but not male competent players. I would say probably the male players in China prefer to choose table tennis, as a joke. Then I would say that they havent woken up. Today Im happy that Ze Zhang beat a Top 20 player in China. I think that's very important, a significant match for him, and he's going to gain more confidence in his professional career. If he failed to win Gasquet today, probably he's going to be a little bit negative towards the match. Its a big step for him to win this match.

If someone slices, if someone really cracks the ball, that's programmed into our minds. So I think that's important.

I've got to take the mental gains that I've made, the physical, the match play, everything.  I've got to try to take out the positives.

He did very well in the first set on his own games, put me under pressure, especially towards the end of the set and the tiebreak. It was a tough set. I thought I played very well against Bautista Agut, but maybe tonight was a bit better.

input yn question: After struggling with your knee and elbow injuries a few years back, some have said that you're playing the best tennis you have played in your career. Is it the physical being the better part, or is it just time, that your game is starting to come together?
input answer: I think it's a bit of time. The elbow and the knee is more of a constant thing. After Australia the knee wasn't feeling that great, and it was a little iffy of whether I was even going to be playing Delray Beach. It's quite temperamental really. It's settled down a lot and it's been feeling better over the last few weeks. Just taking care of that and staying healthy, picking my schedule. I have really put as much emphasis as I can on giving myself the right amount of breaks and really  fortunately being in the position where I can pick and choose my tournaments has helped a lot. Staying healthy is such an important thing. It sounds obvious, but you're not at 100% it's really tough to compete. It really throws you off your whole schedule and your routine. And when you have a good schedule and good routine, I think it's so much easier to feel comfortable and play good tennis.

input answer: I think it would be pretty low from player standards to blame player service or anything else for a loss. I think all the players have been very impressed with the facilities and everyone that's contributed to this tournament. I felt very welcomed from the drivers to the people taking you out on court. Everyone has been super friendly. Facilities themselves I think speak, you know, they speak for itself, because they're great. And with the new stadium coming, I thought the surface was great.

input answer: Well, I have been on the tour for many years. I started as a young teenager, and I'm 25 years old now. I feel like I have seen a lot of different generations. The reality of it is it's not like your generation is going to be the only one playing tennis. You're always going to see new upandcomers and talent, you know, great players that are juniors and that are making the transition from the juniors to the pros, you know, and it's part of it. When you retire, there's always going to be somebody that takes your place in the rankings and the draws. That's just the reality of it. I feel like I'm somewhere in the middle. When I came up, you know, you had Justine and Kim and the Williamses, and I felt I was kind of the younger of the bunch. Now I'm somewhere in the middle.

But, I mean, it is kind of nice being a girl because there are so many of us right now. There is not one sole focus. Then obviously we have Venus and Serena who are still doing really well. Personally, I can't comment on the guys. You'd have to ask them, but I would imagine it's probably I think the girls are a little bit happier with the situation right now.

input yn question: What was the difference today in terms of what allowed Andy to beat you? Do you see yourself and Andy as being maybe the next biggest rivalry in tennis?
input answer: I think we already have a rivalry. It's not the next. It's already existing there for many years. Andy is deservedly a winner today on the court. I thought what made the difference was his serve and my serve. I didn't serve well the first set and a half. After, I just wasn't able to serve. But not taking anything away from him, from his victory. He deserved it. He stepped in, played some great shots. Most of all the moments when he needed to, he served very, very well. Breakpoints that one game, when I had I think four, five opportunities to break back, he just came up always with big serves, so I couldn't do much. But it was a great week all in all for me. I didn't know what to expect obviously coming in, first hard court tournament. I know people always expect me to do well, but I try to be modest with my expectations and just kind of see how each day goes. When I reflect on the week, of course it's positive. I'm playing better as the tournament progressed, and hopefully I can continue in the same style in Cincinnati.

input yn question: Do you get nervous in the majors? What is your mentality in the majors different from the rest of the year?
input answer: I'm not sure. It's just the atmosphere, the tournament around, you know, it is your Grand Slam, and that's what you work hard, very hard, over the many, many years. That's where you want to play your best tennis. I think this kind of, you know, thought, it brings maybe even the best out of myself in a way that I'm really enjoying the challenge and I'm really excited about it. Want to really do well here in Australia and any other Grand Slam.

It always is. I think every Fed Cup tie is tough. There is always really good players playing for their country. Hopefully we beat Italy this time.

input yn question: Is there one issue, Andy, that you would like that person really to tackle when he or she comes in?
input answer: When she comes in, I think -- you know, we've been talking about schedule length for a long time with not a lot of success, you know. There's been, okay, new schedule, new schedule, and we're all supposed to celebrate but it all ends kind of at the same time, and we have to travel to another part of the world and back. I think that's something that needs to be addressed. Not only from a player's perspective as far as injuries. That's probably the main concern. But even giving the fans a chance to miss the game, you know. You're seeing, you know, these NFL shows, these preseason things have been going on for two months now. I think you need a little bit of buildup, maybe a little bit of time to miss it. I think that's something that never really gets talked about. Because you guys get to go to great, fun places, like Basel in the fall.

When you start playing on the courts here, do you think it doesn't matter what happened the last few months, maybe the great form will come back again?
input answer: Playing in New York, it's always good for me. I really love this place. I have a good memories. But I think it's something happen you cannot say why. It just happen because you are there and you are practice and you are try your best all the time. Of course, this place for me, it's special. But I can tell you the first day, when I played the first match, I didn't expect to be here today. I didn't expect to play so good against Sara the day after because the first day I didn't play a good tennis. I was really nervous and tight and everything. But I just try to play all the time my tennis, try to be aggressive, try to do something with the ball, don't thinking about winning or lose, just try to play tennis. I think is the important thing now.

input answer: Well, you always dream about it. You always want to be there. Like I always say, I always believe in myself and I believe I can be here. But obviously when you go through a lot of injuries in your career, it sort of puts a lot of doubts in your head. It is very difficult to come back after an injury. You lose a lot of confidence. But, uhm, I think, I don't know, I always believed in myself. I always believed I could do it. I was just maybe frustrated that my injuries are not going away. But I know as soon as I feel hundred percent, I will be able to play good tennis again. It's just matter of time. Because I can work hard. I can work hard every day.

input yn question: Can you put into words what makes it so difficult playing against Rafa, especially on grass, and the pressure you're constantly under?
input answer: Every time I play him I explain the same thing. It's tough. He makes a lot of balls. He's very good when he's behind. He's one of the best players ever, and a great athlete on top of that. So, you know, even when he's not hitting the ball unbelievable from the middle of the court, he gets to a lot of balls, makes you play an extra ball all the time. And eventually today, like after the first set and a half, when I started making mistakes, he raised his game and started playing better and capitalized on it.

But, no, what I'm doing for -- I wouldn't say for a couple months, but the last year is just great.  I've been so consistent.  But every match is different.  You have to start again all the time. You know if you're not in your best level you know you can lose.  Every time I wake up now I know I can win, I know I can lose.

You know, if you find yourself with a game plan that's just you come out and you're not feeling it or it doesn't quite work, you just really have to find a way to adjust to your opponent and maybe the conditions sometimes and just really figure it out. That's the great thing about the sport is that, you know, you have so many points and so many games, and many, many different situation opportunities. Just really got to take care of them.

I love being in that role of being in the team. To have a shot at even qualifying this year if I do so it will be huge. I think regardless of who's working with me, it's my sort of tennis my game is just it relies on me. People can say they can help you with a lot of tips. Even my dad who has been with me for 11 years has done a great job. You know, that can take the place, but saying people can help, it's not really for my tennis, it's all about me. I've got to find that in me. People give you great tips along the way and can help you and stuff, which I'm ready for any help, but you're not going to become Federer, Rafa, or Novak if you don't do it yourself. That's for sure.

input yn question: With so many titles and records in the bag, how do you assess your hunger and desire? Has it dipped at all? Is it stronger than ever?
input answer: It's normal really. I don't go through phases where I feel like I want to play 10 more years and then only six more months. I always look ahead one and a half to two years, and that's still the same right now. Then as time goes by, you know, you see how the body is. I love this game more than anybody, so I'm not all of a sudden going to wake up in the morning and say I don't like it anymore. It's a lot of sacrifice. It's a lot of effort I have to put in every day. I know that. But I do enjoy that because what I get in return is moments like I got today, with my team, with my family. It's priceless really. So for this reason I'm very excited for next year. I am happy that the season is over because it has been long, it has been grueling. But, yeah, I'm very happy and upbeat about what's to come.

input yn question: Is there anything she did particularly well today that she didn't do well the first three times?
input answer: I think the difference between her on clay and grass and on hard court is her movement.  On clay she struggle a lot more to move and to slide. On grass with some bad bounce and also it's more difficult to move, she really struggled more on this side of her game.  I think her movement is the key of her game.  She is not hitting super hard but she moves very well. I think on the hard courts you have to hit maybe five, six times like this from the lines to make points.  You don't need to hit like this on clay and grass courts.  So on hard courts she's really hard to beat.

That's why they're there. They're coaches. It's their job to try to improve my game and make me feel good, and obviously all it's compromise. Now we have an extra day to the semifinals.

This one is definitely entertaining because I know the guys very well since a long time.  These are the strongest guys basically we have on tour.  It's going to be an entertaining match.

input yn question: When do you think you played your best tennis last year? Was there ever a tournament like you were in the zone the whole time?
input answer: Ah, pretty much all first half of the year. I mean, I played great. Australia was incredible tournament for me, and, you know, when you start year with a Grand Slam win, it gives you a lot of confidence. I was playing on that confidence run, and I was trying to, you know, be 100% committed to every match that I play. I think that mindset that I had on just taking one match at a time helped me to have the streak that I had. But it wasn't easy, of course. Everybody was talk talking about when the loss will come, and it had to come sometime. I was aware of that. But I was not trying to think about loss or trying to think about every win that I had. So I think clay court season was pretty much fantastic for me until the semifinals of French Open.

input answer: Um, I don't know when a time is. I mean, I don't know if it's yesterday, today, or tomorrow. (Smiling.) I mean, I think at way I look at it is the more matches you win, whether it's here, whether it's at a Grand Slam, the better your ranking is gonna be, I mean, yeah, the further you get in a tournament. So. I don't know. I never really focus, this is my time, it's now or never. Might as well -- yeah, I don't know, jump off one of the canyons over there if you have that mentality. It's pretty tough to think like that. You just have to -- you know, even if you do feel -- sometimes you come into a tournament and you feel great and you feel like you're confident and everything's working well, hitting great in practice; sometimes you come in and those things don't quite work match in match situations. Other times you feel kind of crappy on the court, and you come in, and all of a sudden you find yourself swinging away and balls are going in and you're in a later stages of the tournament, you're loose because you didn't really expect much. It's very different. It makes the sport really unique.

input yn question: Do you look at players like Tommy Haas, maybe David Ferrer, does that give you belief that maybe some of your best tennis is ahead of you?
input answer: This year I'm surprised how I feel physically really good at the moment, like better than last two seasons. I think that's because I have stayed healthy for a long time. But obviously it's nice to see other veterans do well. I think our age group is very strong, born '81, '82. There's so many guys that I played against in the juniors. I think we have been helping each other to improve because the competition is so tough. But I have been always a hard worker. That's one of my strengths. I really try to take care of my body and practice hard and well, still rest enough. Also with the experience, I think I know better what suits to me, like when I have to rest, that I don't play too much. Maybe sometimes I play too much, maybe sometimes I play too little. I think all this comes together that seems to make me play better again.

Was there a part of you at all that was genuinely shocked by what happened last night and knowing that this Grand Slam could be about to unfold very differently and you can never take dominance for granted?
input answer: Well, you cannot take for granted anybody. You can't underestimate any opponent. I don't think Rafa did, as well. He's well aware of the quality of all the players on the tour. Rosol is a tall player. He's serving huge. He had a firstserve percentage incredibly well. He's hitting the first shotreally  you know, he's going for everything. It's Grand Slam. It's Wimbledon. Everybody wants to come up with their best game, especially when you're playing one of the top players, one of the favorites. You have nothing to lose. You're out there on the court and you're going for your shots. Obviously I was surprised a little bit with his mental strength in these important moments, Rosol, because he doesn't have much experience playing against the top guys in such important stage. You just can say congratulations. It can serve as an example for everybody that anything is possible in this sport. Even though myself, Rafa, Roger, Murray, a couple other players, we've been dominant in a way in Grand Slams, last couple of years later stages of events, and it's expected us to reach the last four.

input answer: I think they probably get it.  I think from where I see it anyway, I think a lot of people realize how close he is to Roger.  A lot of people, even outside the tennis world, I think realize that he's had Roger's measure in a lot of big matches. You know, he's basically only been two Wimbledon finals where Roger has had the better of him in a lot of ways. When you have a guy like Roger that's had stand-out years the last three or four years, probably better than Pete and Andre and all those guys had at their best.

But now at this point, are you pleased you made that decision to do that then? Was there a point when you worried you might not be ready for this tournament?
input answer: I play Eastbourne first time against Lucie. It was big fight. Very long match. Next day I start to feel the leg. I play against Lepchenko. I won it, but next day I woke up and I really couldn't walk without the pain. It was something actually I didn't do it before, but I knew it's before the Wimbledon.

input answer: I think she's a much better player. She's much stronger physically and mentally just because she had been on the tour for a bit longer now. She's already played lots of top players. Because when you're young and you are coming out of juniors, maybe you don't have that experience. You didn't experience playing so many top players. I think she's got lots of that experience last year. She had to play back to back, you know, top players and had great wins. So she's definitely tough girl to beat at the moment. I think she's improving, and she's going to be a very tough competitor in the future.

Nothing is really routine. You never know how well your opponent is going to play or if you don't have a good day. Obviously it's nice to spend less time on the court, and not be in long sets.

input yn question: The finals in Australia would have hurt him, wouldn't it? I think he's admitted how much that hurt him.
input answer: Well, that's for him to answer really. But, look, he played in couple finals of a Grand Slam, three finals. But, you know, he came back. You have to give him credit for that. It's not easy. Everybody knows that he can win a Grand Slam, but he didn't. But now he's coming back and he's playing really well on grass under all this pressure that he has here. I'm sure he has a lot of motivation, so...

input answer: Well, I think a little bit of both. More of the setting. My first time on Ashe, and it was pretty windy at the beginning. It was kind of windy the whole match, but especially the beginning. It was really windy and my heart was racing for the first hour. You know, also, too, playing Rafa. He's -- the last six months he's lost like one match, so it was kind of a combination.

input yn question: Is it getting easier for you as you play a little bit more this summer to deal to the issues spoke about? And also, are you hearing from people going through similar issues? You feel like you're fulfilling your mission in helping others?
input answer: I hope so. Answer the second part first. I just heard from a kid when I was walking off the court. Thank you for what you do with mental illness. Couldn't have been more than 12, 14 years old. Yeah, that makes me feel good. I wouldn't call it necessarily my mission. I hope to help really bring awareness to show that there can be a role model that can be positive and can shed some light on it and that whole thing. And personally, that stuff is not really in the forefront of my mind. I forgot the first part of your question. Personally that stuff isn't in the forefront of my mind because I'm still trying to I don't want to embarrass myself out here. I played really terribly in the first match that I played in Atlanta and it sort of felt off. Just felt like, Is this going to be a sort of a am I going to be a walkover the whole time? I was real nervous in that match and just did not play well at all. Didn't feel well at all. Felt much better on the doubles court. But I'm glad that it's not that.

input yn question: Is the improvement mainly in conditioning as well as just match experience?
input answer: I think match experience, conditioning. I think physically I'm a lot stronger. Spend a lot of time in the weight room. Got to put most of the credit with my new coach, though. In February -- I went to Australia, cramping in the third set in Australia. Wasn't really playing that great. I came back and I played in Memphis, Delray Beach, was just playing horrible.

I think both things are improving. You know, I'm not really saying, Oh, I want to be top 50 by the end of the year, whatever.

input yn question: When you're going against Soderling, you really made some advances. What is your thought about him? Do you scout him? Do you do anything? Do you just do your thing?
input answer: My thought about him is he's a great player. He's solid. There's not really a lot of holes in his game right now. There used to be the errant ball two or three times in the back fence. That doesn't happen anymore. He's solid. It's something I always tell Jenny and my dad when we're talking about scouting guys. The reality of the matter is I'm not good enough to worry about the other guy. That's the reality of the matter. I don't feel like I'm reliable enough in my game to sacrifice just thinking about my execution out there, what I have to do to play and impose my game. I'm fortunate, because if I do execute my game, there's not a whole lot guys can do in the first place. But, you know, as soon as I get better, more reliable out on the court to where I feel very confident with what I'm doing and how I'm doing it, then I'll start to maybe pick apart guy's games. To be honest, I'm just not at that level right now.

input yn question: Can he be hard on you sometimes?
input answer: As a coach, of course. If I am not ready for practice or if I don't give 100%, of course he tells me, Okay, come on, Caroline, move your butt, because otherwise I'm going to make you run even harder. So I always make sure I'm prepared and 100% ready on the court. But I think that's normal. Off the court, he's my dad; he's my friend. We relax and have a good time off the court. I that balance is very important. For me, I'm this kind of person that I love to work hard and see the results, but I also enjoy just having my own time, relaxing. I have my best friend here, her family, and we are just having a good time in the evening. That just makes me so much more relaxed on the court when I'm there and I can focus 100%.

For me, it doesn't really matter what's happening around any other matches. I just try to concentrate on myself as much as possible, try to improve match to match because I know I need it.

input answer: I'm sure she tries to also find that, I'd say, new source of inspiration and motivation, why she's there, why she's on the court. Also she's 32, 33 years old. She's one of the best tennis players ever to play the game, both women's and men's. She's incredible whatever she does. I probably think she's trying to relieve some of the pressure that she has. Everybody talks about the Serena Slam. Everybody talks about the Golden Slam, will she make it? She has another match, US Open as well. She's so dominant and superior on the court, it's really a pleasure to watch that. I'm sure she has fun, but she also wants to win it. That's for sure.

input yn question: How different has this year been for you? In the past you've had injuries, but things have clicked quite quickly when you started. Obviously you found success quite quickly. Now you've had to be patient and understand things will take their time. Is there this a different sensation for you?
input answer: It's all about moments, and all the moments are different. Different feelings, different situations on the career of everyone. You have to pass all these moments. I had injuries; I had much more good than bad moments. But I had some tough moments with injuries in the past, and now I'm not injured. That's a very important point. I am on the court. If I am on the court, I have the chance to play well and win matches. Last year for six months I didn't have that chance. If I am not winning matches today, I accept. If I am not playing well enough, only thing I can do is accept, stay positive, work as much as I can, and be positive knowing that the normal thing if I had success during 11 years, why can't I have success again if I am motivated enough? I am fit; I don't have injuries; and I cannot forget to play tennis in six months.

input yn question: Looks like Fed Cup has meant so many people are so tired and sick and they went to different continents in very small time. Venus yesterday was telling us that perhaps it should be done in a different way. Do you agree?
input answer: Well, I mean, we are lucky that I was home in my hometown, so I was okay with that. Indoor courts like three minutes from my home. It was really easy. So I was happy about that. Especially that we never played in Krakow before any other tournaments or any matches. But, for example, going to Australia or to China between tournaments in Europe is not really great schedule. So I think what they should maybe do, trying to play in the country that's going to be easier for everyone. I think it shouldn't be any draw, like it just should be the place that is easier for the other WTA tournaments. I think that's always going to be much easier for everyone just to stay very close or even the same country.

It's of course better feeling when you are playing in front of a full stadium or in front of a lot of people. But over here today, I think both of us, Ivan and me, are not the players that are changing our feelings or pushing so much with pumping the fists and things like that. So we are - I guess especially me - I'm just more focused on what I have to do on the court. But anyway, I was feeling good on the court and the stadium is good to play on.

You also got to give the guy a bit of I don't want to say time, but like credit for trying and playing so well in the Masters 1000s. He's won a bunch of those guys now. Obviously clearly the next step for him is to win a Grand Slam. But it's not easy to break through. You have to break through me, I don't know if he's been in another Grand Slam final other than me. There's tough guys at the top right now and they don't give you just an easy match, you know. But he's capable of beating everybody right now. He's proven it. He's beaten everybody multiple times, I think Rafa, Novak, myself. That's what you got to do, and hopefully you can string those matches together when it really matters in slams.

input answer: Uhm, I never really felt it was that way. I don't think I ever said that. I always just feel very good here, around the grounds, on the court. Obviously the more you win, the more confidence you get. Then again, I've learned my lesson early on in my career where I used to underestimate opponents because of the way they played, the way their techniques worked out, or just said against this guy, I can't lose on grass. Next thing you know, that's what happens. This is where you have to be very, very, you know, sort of mentally strong. I think with the success I've had here, obviously I always come in with somewhat of a pressure.

input yn question: This final, we all know that it's very important for the Paris title that you want in your career. Do you think that you will have some different type of approaching Nadal, or will you play the game that you usually play? What do you have in mind in trying how to deal with Nadal?
input answer: Well, there is not going to be a significant difference in my tactics against Nadal comparing to other prior matches that are played, especially the one in Rome. I'm going to try to be aggressive, because that is the only way I can win against him. I know that of course this is the court he's most dominant on. He has only lost one time in his career. This is where he plays his best. It's a very wide and very big court. He likes to have that visual effect, as well, because it appears that he gets every ball back, you know. He feels more comfortable when he plays on the bigger court. That's one of the reasons why he's so successful here. But, you know, we played some really close and good matches, good quality matches the last two years here, especially the one last year serving at 43 in the fifth set to go 53. It was a very close one. And knowing that I was that close to win against him the past two years gives me that reason to believe that I can make it this time. Of course I'm going to go out on the court trying to win, trying to do my best. I'm not going to serve and volley, that's for sure, but I'm going to try to stay with my own tactics. I know what I need to do in order to win. It's easier said than done, of course, because we all know how good he is on this court. But he's not unbeatable. You know, winning against him last couple of matches in the finals, big events, definitely gives me confidence that I can do it again.

Then all of a sudden seven, eight games later, it's just a lot different. You know, but I guess that's the process that it takes to kind of get the surface you want.  I don't know if you're going to get it perfect the first time out.  But it is what it is, man.  I don't mind the surface.  I don't mind the effect that it has.  It's just different.

input yn question: Regardless of the opponent, is that as close to being in the zone as you've been for a little while?
input answer: I mean, I played some really good matches in Sydney where I probably played even better. Movement-wise, I think today -- the ball was in my court. I was able to move her around and still really -- like I didn't feel like I was put under pressure too much by her. Balls were sitting up nice and high, in a nice position, where I was just really able to focus and dictate the points. So that's probably also why it looked easy from my side.

input yn question: When you consider how well you were playing in the tournament, you've had four straight-set matches, pretty dominant performances, can you talk a little bit about your expectations coming in? Can you look back at this point and say, Hey, it was a good tournament? Do you feel you were playing good enough you could win today?
input answer: Of course is a good tournament. If I do second round and I give the best I can, it's good tournament. Of course, if I see a match like this, I want to win. Everybody want to win, so is no need to be upset. But I think today she served good, and with more wind she has more chance than me. Because when I was serving against the wind, I am 1 meter 66, and I try to push as much as I could. But is not like Venus -- she serve on second floor and with the big power. So it's okay. It's not okay, but it's okay.

input yn question: Tell me if really in your mind you thought it was possible to happen this so easily, three sets to love of the champion of last Wimbledon?
input answer: Well, I wouldn't call it easy. I think it was just a tense match if you think about it. Since the first ball we hit on that court, we were both ready to win. But still I think I got early on in the match on top of him, and I think that really helped me, you know, progress in that way. I think second and third set was just a little different. But, I mean, I can't say much about the match because I came out to win the match. I was really positive. I was ready. I had a lot of patience no matter how many sets I was supposed to play. But I was just composed and I was looking for every point that I had to play.

input yn question: After the first match you said you learned so much from last year, even though you didn't win a match. Could you please elaborate a bit? What did you learn from last year's experience, because we see a big difference between two years?
input answer: I learned I shouldn't lose that many matches. But every event you play and every match you play is a new experience and a new challenge, and you just have to accept it that way and take the best out of it. So last year wasn't that much fun for me, haven't won a single set. But I gained that experience. It's different this year, because I'm coming here as a Grand Slam winner and more matured player, stronger mentally and physically on the court. When you have more confidence and believe more in yourself, and of course, you're physically well-rested and fit for challenges, then things are going more smoothly.

input answer: Probably not immediately. I probably need to rest for a little bit. I need to get back physically in shape. I don't feel like I've been in shape for a little while. The last time I've been able to train aggressively is probably May. So I need to put everything aside until I feel ready enough to put myself through the paces. And then I'm ready to hit it, whether it's track or gym. I think that's the first priority. And then when I feel like I'm getting a handle on that, I think the racquets come back in.

I mean, she's a good player, but it was a tough moment for me, and then things suddenly turned everything my way. Now my rank was 115, and then you think; like, Okay, you start to do things like this, you don't get in. I'm not getting in here, not there, wildcard. I mean, you still don't know if they gonna give you wildcard or not. So that was a moment they say, Okay, let's play quallies. I said, Whew, yeah, I will have to play quallies or go to a smaller tournament. But it was a little bit shocking experience, you know. Like sometimes you ask for the wildcard and they say, like, Okay, we will let you know. And it's never letting you know. So...

input answer: Well, I thought his serve was not very good in the beginning, you know.  I thought it was very average actually.  That started to become better as the match went on.  I thought his forehand was very good.  He hits it good inside out.  He hits it good from the forehand corner.  That's why he's a good player. And you know, his backhand, he can take it early, too.  Yeah, he's tough from the baseline and he can slice and dice.  He's a very good all-around player.  Didn't know exactly what to expect because I've never played him.  Now I know and I think he's a good player.

This is my first tournament for the year. I won it last year. I'm not looking at it to defend it. I'm looking at obviously winning another title. If I start looking at defending the title I'll get nervous and I'm probably not going to defend it more than likely.

input yn question: Did you feel that Novak got himself more focused in the second and third sets? What was the difference in his level of play?
input answer: Well, I don't know what was difference. I think it was just small pieces of difference. I don't know how to say it. But in the beginning of the second set, I had like five breakpoints. He had one. He made it, it was 3Love. It could easily be 21 with a break for me, and it was completely other way. So it's tough to say what was different. I think he was playing pretty much the same. But, as I said, the wind doesn't help at all to my game. But it's the same for both of us. I have to deal with that. That's how it is. First set, beginning of the second set, I had a feeling I was even better from the rallies, which is not every time with him. I was beating him from the rallies. But, you know, it just change a bit with the conditions. I didn't keep with that. Him, yes. So that was probably the difference.

You can recover or can be more difficult to recover faster. But, again, you try to do everything you've learned in the past to maybe recover a little bit faster. You have a physio with you 24/7 so you can do a lot to recover for your next match. You just know what helps to you also recover faster.

input answer: Ah, I mean, there is no gap, you know, really. Every tournament is a new opportunity for all the players to win a title. That's how I look at it. Rankings, you know, I don't need to say too much. You have different surfaces, different seasons that, you know, are more suitable to different kind of players. So, you know, clay court is  obviously Nadal and Spanish players, South Americans, are the ones who have, in past couple of years, more success than the others, but, you know, I believe that everybody's improving their game on the different surfaces. It's very demanding, you know. I think I have been playing really well on all different kinds of surfaces.

It really all depended on that.

You know, it's always, how I told you yesterday, I really didn't know what's happening from the first round, and it really takes some time with my confidence. If I'm playing longer in the tournament, deeper, then I more believe in myself maybe, and I just love to play the big matches on the big stadium, and especially the finals, of course.
